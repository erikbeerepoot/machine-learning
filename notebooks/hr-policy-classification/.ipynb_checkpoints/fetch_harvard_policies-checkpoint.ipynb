This\\nprocess is intended to streamline the review process for PIs and\\nadministrators,improve management and administration, and reduce risks for\\nprogram participants, for individual researchers, for Schools, and for Harvard\\nas an institution. This document describes the criteria that determine whether\\na proposal requires Provostial review. Programs and projects that meet these\\ncriteria should be reviewed and approved by the Provost\\'s Office before they\\nare proposed to external funders. When unavoidable, proposals relating to\\ninternational projects may be submitted to external funders prior to\\nProvostial review, as long as they are submitted with the understanding that\\ntheir status is contingent until they are reviewed and approved by the\\nProvost. Within the Provost\\'s Office, proposals may be reviewed by the Vice\\nProvost for Research, the University Director for Sponsored Programs, the Vice\\nProvost for International Affairs and, in the case of some international\\nprojects, also by the University Committee on International Projects and Sites\\n(UCIPS). In all cases, reviewers will consult with others when relevant. Once\\na program or project has received Provostial approval, any significant program\\nexpansions or changes should be submitted through this process, so that\\nadditional Provostial review may occur. 1\\\\. The project has an aggregate\\nbudget of more than $10 million for U.S.-based projects, or is an\\ninternational program whose annual budget is greater than: FAS, HMS $5.0\\nmillion HBS $3.8 million HSPH $3.0 million HLS $1.5 million HKS $1.3 million\\nHGSE,HSDM,GSD,HDS,SEAS,RIAS $1.0 million 2\\\\. The project involves the public\\nuse of Harvard University\\'s name and/or trademark. Projects which use the name\\nof a Harvard School or other subsidiary unit of the University do not need\\nProvost’s Review, but do require approval of the School Dean. Further\\ninformation can be found here, especially question 2. 3\\\\. The project supports\\nthe establishment of any new international site. For this purpose, \"new\\ninternational site\" refers to: (1) real estate, including offices and research\\nspace, outside the U.S. that is leased for Harvard use for a period of six\\nmonths or longer; or (2) a project outside the U.S. to which two or more\\nHarvard faculty members, employees, staff members of an affiliated entity,\\nindependent contractors, post-doctoral fellows, or students are assigned and\\nplaced for a period of six months or longer; or (3) a project that involves\\nsignificant work in, or the posting of a Harvard faculty member, employee,\\nstaff member of an affiliated entity, an independent contractor, post-doctoral\\nfellow, or student to, countries or regions identified as \\'High Risk\\' by\\nHarvard\\'s Global Support Services. 4\\\\. The project is international and\\ninvolves human subjects research that requires IRB expedited or full review.\\nNOTE: If a proposal meets this criterion and no other criterion, it can be\\nreviewed at the time of award rather than at the time of submission. 5\\\\. The\\nproject involves, or is allied with, the direct provision of medical or\\nclinical services. 6\\\\. A majority of funds in the project (over 50%) will not\\nbe expended at Harvard but will be expended through vendors or subcontractors\\nother than Harvard, or a majority of project activities will be conducted by\\npersons who are not Harvard staff. Exception: Projects in which more than 50%\\nof funds are expended at Harvard-affiliated hospitals (list here, under “HMS\\naffiliates”) do not require provostial review. 7\\\\. The project has a\\nsubstantial risk of violating Harvard\\'s anti-discrimination policy. 8\\\\. The\\nsponsor or project may present a serious reputational risk for the University\\nor may otherwise attract significant adverse publicity to the University. 9\\\\.\\nThe project involves activities for which there is inadequate or uncertain\\nprogram, financial and/or managerial infrastructure, which may be a special\\nconcern in projects that take place outside the United States. 10\\\\. The\\nproject involves a scope, scale, or type of work that is beyond the\\nUniversity\\'s teaching and research mission or is especially unusual or\\ncomplex. Procedures: Proposals should be submitted for Provostial Review and\\nApproval before the proposal is filed with potential funders, if at all\\npossible, and in all cases before the activity is initiated. The OSP or SPA\\nreviewer will edit the Required Signatures in GMAS and add the “Provost\\nSignatory” role to the list, which alerts the Associate Research Compliance\\nCoordinator that there is an actionable item for Provostial Review. The\\nAssociate Research Compliance Coordinator will add additional OVPR reviewers\\nif necessary. Using the text box in the “GMAS Signature Required” email\\ngeneration screen, OSP/SPA reviewer will specify a department contact, the\\nsponsor deadline, and a brief statement indicating the particular element(s)\\nof the proposal that has triggered the need for Provostial Review. The Provost\\nReviewer will navigate to the GMAS Request Home Page from the email and\\nperform the review and, if no concerns, will electronically sign indicating\\napproval to OSP/SPA that they may move forward with the submission or\\nexecution of the award agreement. If there are additional considerations or\\nrestrictions placed on the project, they will be communicated to the\\ndepartment contact, PI, and OSP/SPA reviewer. See also: Preparing a Proposal\\n\\n'), None, ('Office of the Provost', 'HOME / POLICIES / Principles and Guidelines for the Establishment of Centers\\nThe “Principles and Guidelines” were considered over a number of months by the\\nAcademic Advisory Group, consisting of the President, the Provost, and Deans,\\nand approved by the Group in final form as of November 5, 2002. They are\\ndesigned to provide a framework for the establishment and review of centers\\nthat supports their desired functions while minimizing negative impact and\\nrisk. Each School or Faculty should have published criteria and a formal\\napproval process for the establishment of centers (or their equivalent under\\nanother name) and provide for comprehensive review of their activities at\\nspecified intervals. Except as outlined below, new centers or institutes, or\\nany other semi-autonomous programs or projects with annual budgets in excess\\nof $500,000, may be established only with the approval of the Dean and the\\nProvost, subject, where appropriate, to review by the President or\\nCorporation. Such approval is not required for activities with annual budgets\\nin excess of $500,000 that are formed according to the normal procedures of a\\nSchool within a School’s existing departmental structures, or, in the case of\\nSchools without departments, within existing internal processes for school-\\nwide resource allocation. A School or Faculty’s process for the establishment\\nand review of such centers, institutes, programs or projects should\\nincorporate the following elements: Principles Each center should have a\\nclearly defined mission that supports the major strategic objectives and core\\nacademic mission of the School, and adds value to the School and the\\nUniversity; Centers should contribute to the teaching, research, and/or\\ntraining missions of the School or Faculty; The mission and activities of the\\nCenter should not duplicate those accomplished by an existing department or\\ncenter within the School, and proposed new centers should be reviewed in the\\ncontext of other activities that are ongoing within the University to ensure\\nthat the University’s overall effort in a given field of inquiry is\\nstrengthened; Centers often, though not always, are interdepartmental or\\ninterfaculty in character, providing opportunities for new interrelationships\\nwithin the School, the university, or broader intellectual and other\\ncommunities; Each center should be directed by a senior faculty member, except\\nin extraordinary circumstances, and the bulk of the center’s work should be\\ncarried out under the direction of faculty members; Center directors should\\nordinarily serve for specified terms, not to exceed five years, subject to\\nrenewal by the Dean, or, in the case of interfaculty centers, by the Provost;\\nA center’s academic focus should be defined broadly enough to attract the\\nintellectual and professional participation of a critical mass of faculty\\nmembers, and students should be involved in a center’s work and activities in\\nsignificant and systematic ways; A center should not be formed except in\\ncircumstances in which several senior faculty members, at least, plan to be\\nseriously involved in the work of the center, and the center’s viability does\\nnot depend on the work of a single faculty member; Centers should be\\nfinancially self-sustaining, or deemed worthy of core support or cost-sharing\\nat the time they are established; Funding for the establishment of centers\\nshould be designed with sufficient flexibility to accommodate shifting\\nintellectual priorities or organizational arrangements over time; All centers\\nshould be subject to periodic review, with meaningful participation from\\ndisinterested outsiders. Guidelines for Initial Approval The case for the\\nestablishment of a center should include, at a minimum, the following\\nelements: A strategic plan, encompassing academic, financial and operational\\ncomponents, with identifiable objectives covering the initial period of period\\nof operation, or, for an endowed center, outlining longer term objectives with\\na view toward appropriate flexibility over time; A funding plan adequate to\\nmeet the strategic objectives of the center over the expected period of its\\noperation; A steering committee composed of individuals with relevant\\nexpertise; Consideration of the mission and work of the proposed center in\\nlight of other work within the School or the University in related fields;\\nProvision for annual review by the School or Faculty of the center’s non-\\nfaculty academic or research appointments and affiliates, with presumption\\nagainst such appointments extending beyond two years without prior approval by\\nDean or his or her designee. Provision for written annual progress reports,\\nmeasuring the success of the center in meeting its goals and objectives.\\nGuidelines for Periodic Review In addition to annual reviews, each center\\nshould undergo comprehensive reviews, at intervals not to exceed every five\\nyears, by a body consisting of a meaningful proportion of disinterested\\noutside experts with a view to the following: A comprehensive evaluation of\\nthe center, including the performance of its director, and an assessment of\\nits intellectual and other contributions to the mission of its School or\\nFaculty; An assessment of the breadth and intensity of senior faculty\\nparticipation, to ensure that the viability of the center does not depend\\neither intellectually or financially on a single individual; An assessment of\\nthe financial and administrative soundness of the center; An assessment, at\\nthe time of the review, of the ongoing relevance of the center’s work to the\\nmission of the School or Faculty in which it is housed; A written report\\ncontaining findings and recommendations for improvement or change, as\\nappropriate. Reviews aimed at assessing the above-stated objectives should\\nalso be conducted on an ad hoc basis at the direction of the Dean of a School\\nor the President or Provost, when there is reason to be concerned about the\\nongoing ability of a center or program to meet the academic, financial, or\\noperating criteria specified in “Principles and Guidelines” above. Guidelines\\nfor Discontinuance When it becomes clear that a center, institute, project or\\nprogram should not continue in existence, the Dean of the School, in close\\nconsultation with the Provost (or the Provost, in the case of an interfaculty\\ncenter or program) should move systematically to discontinue the operations of\\nthe entity. Care should be taken with regard to personnel issues, the\\ndisposition of funds, the reassignment of activities, as appropriate, and the\\nmany other considerations entailed in phasing out an operation. Any issues\\nthat risk the creation of financial, legal, or public exposure for the\\nUniversity should be raised early and coordinated closely with the Office of\\nthe President and Provost, and such other personnel as necessary and\\nappropriate.\\n\\n'), ('Office of the Provost', \"HOME / POLICIES / Provost's Statement about the Establishment of Centers\\nWithin universities, basic disciplines tend to be represented by departments.\\nDisciplines and their departments change or dissolve very slowly. Universities\\nhave evolved myriad organizational forms to facilitate work on problems or in\\nfields that are not adequately treated by discipline-based departments. At\\nHarvard, we tend to call such forms centers or programs or, less commonly,\\ninstitutes. Universities need both the stable foundations that departments and\\nschools provide and flexible organizational forms that can be launched and\\ngrown, shrunk and eliminated or absorbed, or crystallized into more permanent\\nforms, depending on the ebb and flow of intellectual opportunity and change.\\nWhen centers are appropriately designed, ably led, regularly reviewed, and\\ncarefully integrated with a school’s core mission, they can make essential and\\npowerful contributions to Harvard’s academic life, as many of them have. On\\nthe other hand, as the Deans have recently discussed, centers can also create\\nserious administrative, fiscal, and intellectual problems for the faculties\\nand the University. For example, some centers are only tangentially connected\\nto the core mission of a School, having been established to meet donor\\ninterests or by an entrepreneurial faculty member or affiliate without\\nadequate input from a school’s leadership or from significant group of faculty\\nmembers. Moreover, certain centers have become long-term homes for non-faculty\\nappointees who are not subject to the kind of academic review required of\\nfaculty members. Furthermore, centers designed as vehicles for exploring\\nemergent fields can persist long after the intellectual case for them has\\neroded. In some cases, they compete with departments for funding, space, and\\nother resources, distracting the faculties from their core activities.\\nAlthough some subjects are appropriately addressed through durable or semi-\\npermanent programs or centers, centers should presumptively be viewed as\\nflexible, time-limited organizational forms.\\n\\n\"), ('Office of the Provost', 'HOME / POLICIES / Residency Guidelines For degrees that do not meet the one-\\nyear residency requirement Formal approval All new degrees and substantial\\nchanges to existing degrees must be approved by the Corporation. Residence at\\nthe University has long been an important component of a Harvard education and\\nis expected to remain the norm for most degree programs. The Harvard\\nUniversity Statutes currently state that “Ordinarily, a residence at the\\nUniversity of at least one year spent in full-time study at the full tuition\\nrate is required for each degree, except in the case of candidates for the\\ndegree of Associate of Arts or Bachelor of Arts in Extension Studies.”\\nProposed degree programs that do not comply with the one-year residency\\nrequirement should be reviewed by the Provost’s Office prior to consideration\\nby the Corporation. In most cases, an ad hoc faculty committee will review the\\nproposal and advise the Provost. Committee membership will be drawn from the\\nseveral faculties. Principles Residential programs remain the gold standard in\\nhigher education when one considers the total student experience. While all\\nacademic programs have critical academic goals that require and measure\\ntangible progress toward a degree (e.g. demonstrable domain knowledge,\\nanalytical ability, reasoning, various forms of expression and critical\\nthinking), many argue that the impact of their programs is better described in\\nterms of personal growth, professional transformation, and intellectual\\nsocialization. Fulfilling credit requirements with acceptable grades alone\\ndoes not adequately capture these other essential dimensions. These “soft”\\ngoals are largely a by-product of the residential experience; many of the most\\nvaluable student experiences are unplanned and are a function of being in a\\nselect peer group in an intellectual community. The benefits of being in-\\nresidence do not accrue uniformly to all types of academic programs or to all\\nphases of one’s educational experience. For example, while all might argue\\nthat residence is essential today for what all desire and expect of Harvard\\nCollege, it may not be essential--in fact it may be undesirable--for a mid-\\ncareer program in clinical effectiveness where most of the students are junior\\nfaculty at other academic medical centers. Therefore one can vigorously defend\\na 100% residency mandate in certain academic programs while being quite open\\nto hybrid delivery models for others. Definitions Types of degree programs are\\ndefined as follows: Traditional residential degree programs are programs that\\nmeet the one-year residency requirement. Alternative residential degree\\nprograms are 100% residential, but are based on alternative residential\\nexperiences (e.g. evenings, weekends, summer or winter session). Hybrid degree\\nprograms involve residential, off-site, and online learning components where\\nthe non-residential activities are officially credited toward degree\\nrequirements (e.g. applied research projects at a host institution, field\\nstudy, online student sections, video-on-demand of lectures and related\\nproblems sets, class sessions based on video conferencing). Online programs\\nare conducted entirely online or do not require residential participation to\\nmeet degree requirements. Guidelines for review and approval process Academic\\nreview of new degree programs or change of criteria in existing degree\\nprograms within each school should occur in the same manner as traditional\\nacademic programs (i.e. no separate review and approval process). These\\nprograms require final approval by the President and Fellows of Harvard\\nCollege (i.e. the Corporation). Proposed alternative residential and hybrid\\nprograms that do not follow the one-year residency requirement should be\\nreviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by an ad hoc review process\\nunder the leadership of the Provost following academic review within each\\nschool. Final approval is required by the President and Fellows of Harvard\\nCollege. Should online programs be addressed in the future, a similar review\\nand approval process would apply. New degree programs should be reviewed on a\\n3- and 5-year basis for continuation. Applied field projects (and the like)\\nshould be conducted under the direct supervision of Harvard faculty.\\nProgrammatic guidelines for degree programs No change in the residency\\nrequirement will be allowed for undergraduate (College) or advanced research\\ndegrees (e.g. Ph.D., DBA, D.Ed., D.Sc., D. Ed.). No fully online degrees are\\nbeing considered at this time. New alternative residential masters degree\\nprograms will be allowed provided “the residential experience provides for at\\nleast as much time in structured learning activities (e.g. in-class, in-lab,\\nin-study section) and a similar (equivalent) opportunity for face-to-face\\nfaculty-student interaction and student-student contact as full-time\\nresidential programs.” (In essence, this would open the door to programs that\\nwere 100% residential, but composed of non-traditional terms (e.g. two summers\\nand a fall semester, two winters and a spring, a term here and a term away,\\netc)). Proposed programs that are not 100% residential will be considered, but\\nshould be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by an ad hoc review\\nprocess following academic review within each school. Non-residential\\ncomponents should not ordinarily exceed 25% of the program of study and\\ninnovations should first be proven, in concept, in traditional residential\\nprograms where possible. All degree programs should be led by the appropriate\\nfull-time faculty and have a similar mix of teaching faculty as current degree\\nprograms (i.e. no separate class of faculty for new programs). Alternative\\nresidential degree programs and hybrid degree programs should typically be\\ndesigned for mid-career or 2nd professional degree students. Proposed programs\\nmust present a plan for financial stability including how administrative\\nprocesses will accommodate shifting faculty and student schedules.\\n\\n'), ('Office of the Provost', 'HOME / POLICIES / Statement of the President and Deans on University Rights\\nand Responsibilities 2002 In view of events last spring and beyond, questions\\nhave been raised about Harvard\\'s policies regarding protests and\\ndemonstrations. We take this opportunity to affirm our shared commitment to an\\nacademic community in which all members of the University are able to express\\ntheir views freely and vigorously. We also affirm our commitment to ensuring\\nthat all members of the University are able to carry out their normal duties\\nand activities in support of the University\\'s mission without interference or\\nconstraint by others. These commitments are expressed in the longstanding\\nUniversity-wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities. We believe it is\\ntimely to remind the University community of this longstanding policy\\nstatement and its application to unauthorized occupation of University\\nbuildings. To highlight that aspect of the existing policy, we have proposed\\nand the Governing Boards have adopted an \"interpretation\" of the Statement,\\nparallel to a prior \"interpretation\" regarding personal harassment. The newly\\nadopted interpretation has been appended to the University-wide Statement on\\nRights and Responsibilities and now appears at the bottom of its text. While\\nwe recognize that the determination of specific penalties for violation of\\nthis policy by students is primarily the responsibility of the several\\nfaculties, we regard it as essential that there be shared understandings\\nacross the University that emphasize the serious nature of building\\noccupations that interfere with the ability of members of the University to\\ncarry out their normal duties and activities and the serious consequences that\\nshould follow from such interference. We are therefore informing the relevant\\nofficers and committees in our faculties of our shared view that students who\\nengage in such conduct should ordinarily be subject to suspension, and that\\nothers who engage in similar conduct should be subject to appropriate\\nsanction. Of course, applicable laws may also bear on such conduct, and the\\nUniversity-wide Statement itself has potential application to many other forms\\nof conduct. We also believe it important, when a building occupation or\\nsimilar acts involve participants from different Schools, that steps be taken\\ntoward coordination in the approach to discipline, including possible\\nreference to the University-wide Committee on Rights and Responsibilities.\\n\\n'), ('Office of the Provost', 'HOME / POLICIES / Statement on Outside Activities of Holders of Academic\\nAppointments Faculty members and other academic appointees at Harvard\\nparticipate in a wide range of outside activities related to their scholarly\\ninterests. Such activities can advance the search for knowledge, bring fresh\\ninsights into Harvard classrooms, and further the University\\'s broad interest\\nin serving society. At the same time, the University and its members have long\\nrecognized that persons holding academic appointments at Harvard should\\nconduct outside professional pursuits in ways that respect their\\nresponsibilities to their home institution. Along with status as a full-time\\nHarvard academic appointee comes the expectation that one\\'s primary\\nprofessional duties are to Harvard, and that outside professional activities\\nwill not conflict with obligations to one’s students, to colleagues, and to\\nthe University as a whole. Over the decades this understanding has been\\nreflected in a variety of policy statements, some of them University-wide in\\napplication, others specific to individual Faculties. The most relevant\\nUniversity-wide policy, the \"Stipulations\" adopted by the Corporation in 1948,\\ndirectly addresses the obligations of academic appointees in regard to outside\\nactivities. [i] The most important provision of the Stipulations states that\\nanyone holding a full-time academic appointment at Harvard should not, without\\npermission of the Corporation upon recommendation of the appropriate Dean,\\nengage in teaching, research, or salaried consulting at any other educational\\ninstitution during the academic year. The circumstances assumed by the\\nStipulations have evolved over recent decades as faculty and other members of\\nthe University have been presented with more opportunities to pursue a wider\\nrange of outside activities, as new information technologies have come to the\\nfore, and as the number and kind of relationships with external organizations\\nhave expanded. Consequently, questions have been raised about the\\ninterpretation of the Stipulations in these changing circumstances, and the\\nneed for clarification of the policy on outside activities has become evident.\\nThis Statement on Outside Activities is intended to serve that purpose. A\\ndraft of the Statement was reviewed by the Deans of the Faculties, then\\ndiscussed and revised by an Advisory Committee to the Provost composed of\\nfaculty members from each of the Faculties of the University. Further\\nrevisions were made in response to comments received from all the Faculties.\\nThe version of the Statement presented here now replaces the Stipulations.\\n[ii] The Statement provides a contemporary interpretation of longstanding\\nprinciples that offer guidance on the conduct of outside professional\\nactivities, emphasizing those undertaken with educational or research\\nenterprises other than Harvard. It is framed in broad terms, both to allow\\ndiscretion in the application of its provisions to individual cases, and to\\npermit the individual Faculties—consistent with the general guidelines\\npresented here—to maintain and develop more specific policies applicable to\\ntheir own settings. Although some of the provisions in the Statement refer\\nonly to full-time appointees, part-time appointees are expected to stay alert\\nto the underlying concerns it addresses, and seek guidance from their Dean\\nwhen their outside activities may reasonably appear relevant to any of those\\nconcerns. This Statement does not seek to define who owns the products of\\nteaching and research at Harvard, but rather aims to clarify what obligations\\nacademic appointees have to their students, colleagues, and the institution\\nwhen they engage in teaching, research, and related activities outside the\\nUniversity. The Statement thus focuses on use, not ownership. Standards\\nrelating to intellectual property and revenue sharing are described in the\\nUniversity’s policy on inventions, patents, and copyrights. [iii] In the\\nsections that follow, the Statement elaborates on these basic principles:\\npersons holding full-time academic appointments should concentrate their\\nteaching efforts on Harvard students; they should conduct all their research\\nin a manner consistent with University norms; and they should ensure that the\\nnature of their outside professional activities, the time devoted to them, and\\ntheir actual and perceived association with Harvard do not conflict with\\nobligations to students, colleagues, and the University. 1\\\\. Teaching Persons\\nholding full-time academic appointments at Harvard should devote their\\nteaching efforts primarily to the education of Harvard students. Faculty\\nmembers may not hold a regular faculty appointment at another institution,\\nexcept in connection with a Harvard-sponsored joint program with that\\ninstitution, or similar arrangement as approved by their Dean. They should not\\nteach a course, or a substantial portion of a course, at or for another\\ninstitution or organization without the advance permission of their Dean and\\nthe Corporation. This policy should be followed regardless of whether the\\nactivity is conducted in person or through some form of electronic\\ncommunication. These standards reflect the traditional understanding that\\nfull-time Harvard faculty members and other academic appointees are expected\\nto concentrate their teaching efforts on students enrolled in Harvard\\'s\\neducational programs. This understanding expresses the reasonable expectation\\nthat Harvard students will have special access to an education distinctive to\\nthe University they attend, and that teaching efforts of Harvard faculty\\nmembers will be directed primarily toward the benefit of the University and\\nits members. It also affirms the University’s interest in ensuring that\\nHarvard teachers not be deflected from their primary commitment to educate\\nHarvard students by assuming competing obligations to teach for other\\ninstitutions, and the University\\'s interest in discouraging other institutions\\nfrom drawing inappropriately on the University’s reputation and the collective\\ncontributions of its members. A Harvard appointee holding the rank of\\nprofessor, associate professor, or assistant professor (or other title as may\\nbe designated by a particular Faculty) thus may not also hold a regular\\nacademic appointment at another institution. (Exceptions may be made in\\nconnection with a Harvard-sponsored joint program with another institution,\\nsuch as the Health Sciences and Technology program conducted by the Harvard\\nMedical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or similar\\narrangements approved by the responsible Dean.) When teaching at or for\\nanother institution is expressly approved on a temporary basis, the limited\\nnature of the association should be clearly indicated, normally by including\\n\"visiting\" in the Harvard faculty member’s title (as in \"visiting professor\"\\nor \"visiting instructor\"). While faculty members are expected to concentrate\\ntheir teaching efforts on Harvard students, many faculty also make use of\\nopportunities to share their educational and scholarly products with the wider\\nworld of higher education and beyond. Such activities are not intended to be\\ndiscouraged by this Statement. Giving occasional lectures, serving on\\ndissertation committees, and similar activities at other institutions are\\nconsidered an important aspect of citizenship in the academic community, and\\nrequire no official permission. Making course materials available on web sites\\nand through other electronic formats can also be a valuable service to many\\noutside the University, and under appropriate conditions does not require\\nofficial approval. For example, a faculty member does not need permission to\\ndistribute curricular materials on a non-exclusive basis if they were produced\\nwithout a substantial University contribution and do not constitute a\\nsubstantial portion of a course. One reason for the distinction between such\\nactivities and those that are like a regular course concerns the amount of\\ntime and effort required. Teaching a course at another institution usually\\nentails greater absence from Harvard and greater deflection of energy from\\nHarvard teaching responsibilities than do the activities mentioned above. But\\nbroader considerations than the time and energy required are also at stake. It\\nis important not only to avoid conflicting time commitments, but also to\\nabstain from extramural activities inconsistent with one’s primary teaching\\nobligation to the University, its Faculties, and its students. That the\\nconsiderations extend beyond the element of time is worth emphasizing when new\\ntechnologies make it possible to teach vast numbers of students dispersed\\nacross the country and around the world without leaving one’s own campus and\\nwith a comparatively modest investment of time. Modern technology enables a\\nfaculty member to videotape an entire course in a short period of time, and to\\nmake the resulting materials available to an educational organization for its\\nown exclusive purposes or for licensing to other organizations for\\npresentation in classrooms, on-line, or through other media. The fact that the\\ncourse materials could be produced during a vacation or \"after hours\" does not\\nallay the concern that such arrangements may conflict with professional\\nobligations to Harvard and its students. A Harvard academic appointee should\\ntherefore not participate in teaching courses for another institution or\\norganization in these direct or indirect ways without express permission of\\nthe Dean of the Faculty and of the Corporation. Genuinely difficult questions\\nare likely to arise in the application of this policy, especially as new\\ninformation technologies expand the range of possibilities. Basic distinctions\\n(for example, between extramural teaching and more limited sharing of course\\nmaterials) will have to be refined as new cases present themselves. This\\nStatement does not purport to prescribe a set of rigid rules, but rather seeks\\nto maintain an environment in which faculty members and other academic\\nappointees will exercise caution in undertaking activities that could\\nreasonably be perceived as teaching at or for other institutions or\\norganizations. In such cases, academic appointees are expected to consult in\\nadvance with their Dean and, if in the Dean’s judgment the activity falls\\nwithin the scope of this Statement, with the Corporation. In determining the\\nextent to which an activity is appropriate, members of the University should\\nfollow this general guideline: the more it reasonably appears that a faculty\\nmember is teaching or producing a course or a substantial portion of a course\\nfor another institution or organization, the more likely it is that the\\nactivity falls outside the range of what is appropriate. (What is to count as\\na course is to be understood in terms of the curricular offerings in the\\nrelevant Faculty at Harvard.) Among the most important factors to consider in\\napplying this guideline are: the terms under which the material is\\ndistributed, marketed, or otherwise made available to students and other\\npotential users; the role of the material in the outside organization’s\\ncurriculum or educational program; the nature of the Harvard teacher’s\\naffiliation with the outside organization and how it is characterized; and the\\nother factors relevant to all outside activities (listed in the last paragraph\\nof Section 5). Some Faculties of the University have policies that govern\\ntraditional in-class teaching at other educational institutions during the\\nsummer and sabbatical leaves, and teaching in short-term seminars or\\ninstructional sessions during the academic year. This Statement is not\\nintended to disturb these traditional practices, or require Corporation\\napproval for them. However, when any such teaching generates materials in\\nelectronic format, Corporation approval is required before they may be used as\\na course or substantial portion of a course at a later time at an institution\\nother than Harvard. When such teaching is expected to generate course\\nmaterials to be used in this way, permission should be sought in advance. 2\\\\.\\nResearch Persons holding full-time academic appointments should at all times\\nconduct their research in a manner befitting a member of the University. They\\nshould observe the applicable policies of their Faculties regarding conflicts\\nof interest and related matters. Research appointments at another university\\nor academic institution may be accepted only with advance permission of the\\nresponsible Dean. Projects on which a Harvard academic appointee serves as a\\nprincipal investigator or in an analogous role should be administered through\\nthe University or its affiliated medical institutions, unless the responsible\\nDean has specifically granted an exception. The University affirms the broad\\ndiscretion of scholars to choose the topics of their research, to formulate\\nhypotheses and present conclusions, to express views about the implications of\\ntheir research, and in general to enjoy the protections of academic freedom.\\nFreedom of inquiry and expression for individual scholars stands at the core\\nof the values of the University. At the same time, faculty members and other\\nacademic appointees are expected to conduct their research in a manner\\nbefitting a member of the Harvard community. Various policies have evolved\\nover the years to address such aspects of research conduct as conflicts of\\ninterest and commitment, disclosure of data and findings, classified and\\nproprietary work, and the participation of human subjects in research. [iv]\\nThis Statement presupposes these policies, and is intended only to underscore\\ntwo specific points about the conduct of research. First, full-time academic\\nappointees should not accept a regular research position with another\\nuniversity or academic enterprise unless permission is obtained from their\\nresponsible Dean in advance. The appropriateness of such a position should be\\ndetermined by considerations similar to those governing teaching appointments\\n(Section 1) and those relevant to all outside activities (Section 5). As in\\nthe case of summer school teaching, faculty paid on an academic year basis do\\nnot need permission to accept research appointments during the summer if the\\nrules of their Faculty authorize such activity. When an outside research\\nappointment is accepted or permitted, care should be taken to make clear that\\nthe relationship with the other organization is limited in scope, time, and\\ntitle. Second, when a full-time Harvard faculty member or other academic\\nappointee serves on a research project as principal investigator or in an\\nanalogous position, the project should generally be administered through the\\nUniversity (or the affiliated medical institution where the appointee is\\nbased).[v] This policy is applicable regardless of the type of sponsorship\\n(e.g., grant, contract, or cooperative agreement) or funding source\\n(governmental or private support). Proceeding in this way helps to ensure that\\nthe research is carried out in a manner consistent with applicable University\\nand Faculty policies; that colleagues and students have appropriate\\nopportunities directly to participate in, and to learn from, the research\\nactivities of Harvard scholars; that comprehensive and up-to-date information\\ncan be maintained about sponsored research conducted by all members of the\\nUniversity; and that appropriate financial reimbursements (such as for\\noverhead costs) accrue to the University. There are circumstances in which it\\nmay not be feasible or desirable for the research of faculty members to be\\nadministered through Harvard. Major collaborative projects, such as research\\nat CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics), call for somewhat\\ndifferent arrangements. Also, when a Harvard researcher is collaborating with\\na colleague at another institution, joint institutional administration of the\\nproject may be impractical or unwise, and the other institution may be better\\nsituated to manage the project. Furthermore, some longstanding agreements with\\nother research institutions may require special arrangements. In these and\\nother exceptional cases, advance approval for administration of the project\\noutside Harvard should be sought from the appropriate Dean. (Individual\\nFaculties may wish to define categories of exceptional cases to avoid\\nunnecessary case-by-case review.) 3\\\\. Consulting and Related Activities In\\nundertaking consulting and related outside professional activities, faculty\\nmembers and other academic appointees should take care to observe the limits\\non the amount of time properly devoted to such activities and to avoid\\nsituations in which the activities may create a conflict with their\\nresponsibilities as an officer of the University. Academic appointees should\\nnot engage in paid consulting at or for another educational institution or\\neducational organization without prior approval from their Dean and the\\nCorporation. By offering counsel to individuals and organizations outside\\nHarvard, members of the University community can broaden their experience in\\nways that benefit teaching and research, and can bring academic knowledge to a\\nwider public in ways that contribute to the well-being of society. The\\nUniversity therefore has traditionally authorized faculty members and other\\nacademic appointees to devote a portion of their professional effort to\\noutside activities related to their areas of expertise, subject to limits on\\nthe amount of time devoted to such activities. The most prevalent standard for\\nthe amount of time that may be spent on professional activities outside\\nHarvard states that no more than 20 per cent of one’s total professional\\neffort may be directed to outside work. This standard should be regarded as\\nthe maximum that should be permitted by any Faculty within the University.\\nIndividual faculties may set more stringent limits, and may specify their own\\ninterpretations of this standard (such as \"one day in seven,\" or \"40 days a\\nyear\"), subject to review as the Corporation may deem appropriate. However,\\nthe rules of each Faculty should clearly state the standard, explain how it is\\nto be interpreted, and describe a procedure for disclosure or consultation to\\ndeal with cases in which faculty members may be approaching or exceeding the\\nlimit. A summary of the rules and their accompanying commentary should be\\nsubmitted to the Provost, who will make it available to all the Faculties of\\nthe University. As in the case of teaching, time is not the only consideration\\ndetermining the appropriateness of consulting and related outside activities.\\nThe more general concern is that such activities should not conflict with\\none’s paramount obligations to students, colleagues, and the University.\\nFaculty members and other academic appointees are therefore expected to ensure\\nthat any outside professional activities in which they engage are consistent\\nwith the general policies of the University and those of their own Faculty.\\nThis can require attention not only to the overall time expended but also to\\nthe nature of specific activities and the individual\\'s role in them. [vi]\\nFull-time appointees should not engage in paid consulting for another\\neducational institution or educational organization without the permission of\\ntheir Dean and the Corporation. Customary professional service—such as\\nparticipation on visiting committees, on boards of trustees of other colleges\\nand universities, or in professional associations—generally poses no serious\\nconflicts and may be undertaken without prior approval. (The acceptance of\\ncustomary honoraria does not transform such service into paid consulting.)\\nConsulting for primary and secondary schools or other educational institutions\\nas a specific part of one’s Harvard research and teaching, as occurs in the\\nSchool of Education, or consulting as a specific part of research with\\ncolleagues elsewhere, as occurs in the Schools of Public Health and Medicine,\\nrequires only the permission of the responsible Dean. Some outside activities,\\nwhether paid or not, tend to raise such serious concerns that they are\\npresumptively inappropriate and should rarely be undertaken, and then only\\nafter careful review and explicit approval. For example, an academic appointee\\nshould not \"assume executive responsibilities for an outside organization that\\nmight seriously divert his or her attention from University duties, or create\\nother conflicts of loyalty.\"[vii] Other activities, such as having a financial\\ninterest in a company that could reasonably appear to be affected by an\\nindividual’s research, may be permitted under certain conditions, but require\\ndisclosure under sponsored research regulations and University policy.[viii]\\nThese examples are illustrative, not exhaustive, and academic appointees are\\nexpected to stay alert to all the possible conflicts of interest and\\ncommitment as described in the relevant rules of their Faculties. 4\\\\. Use of\\nUniversity Identification Members of the University are expected to take\\nindividual responsibility for their participation in any outside activity, and\\nuse their best efforts to avoid false or misleading suggestions by others that\\nthe activity is an undertaking of Harvard or any of its units. In general, all\\nmembers should observe the University’s policy on the use of the Harvard name,\\nand limit their identification with Harvard to listing their formal titles as\\nappropriate. The University and its members have a shared interest in the use\\nof the Harvard name and related insignias and images. Over generations, the\\nname has been invested with value through the efforts of innumerable\\nindividuals. It is an intellectual as well as a financial asset in which the\\nmembers of the University have a common stake. To protect that value,\\nindividual members are expected in their outside activities to observe the\\nUniversity\\'s policy on the use of its names, insignias, and images. [ix] In\\ngeneral, when pursuing outside activities, members should limit their\\nidentification with Harvard to listing their formal titles, and should\\notherwise aim to make clear that they are acting as individuals and not on\\nbehalf of the University. They should also take reasonable precautions to\\nprevent the organizations and individuals with whom they work from using the\\nHarvard name, or making representations about Harvard, in ways that suggest\\nthat the University sponsors or endorses their activities. Attaching a Harvard\\nname or symbol to an activity implies a form of institutional accountability\\nthat is ordinarily absent from outside activities undertaken by individual\\nmembers of the University. 5\\\\. Procedures Persons holding academic\\nappointments should inform themselves about University-wide and Faculty-\\nspecific policies governing outside activities, and should observe the\\nspecific requirements of those policies. They should consult their Dean in\\ncases where the appropriateness of an activity may reasonably be in question.\\nAll members of the University share an interest in protecting the values\\nexpressed by the principles that govern outside activities, and may be\\nexpected to take personal responsibility for respecting those principles.\\nElaborate procedures for enforcement at the level of the University are\\ntherefore neither necessary nor desirable. In any case, the nature and range\\nof outside activities are too varied to be covered in detail by any succinct\\nand general statement of policy. Faculty members and other academic appointees\\nare responsible for requesting permission to engage in outside activities when\\nrequired by this Statement or by other University or Faculty policies.\\nAppointees should consult with their Deans and other appropriate officials of\\nthe University before pursuing activities that might be cause for concern.\\nAppointees affiliated with more than one Faculty must comply with the\\napplicable rules of all Faculties in which they hold appointments. As faculty\\nmembers, Deans themselves have a similar responsibility with regard to their\\nown outside activities, except that they consult with the President or\\nProvost. The Faculties have adopted various approaches to the reporting of\\noutside activities by academic appointees. The University does not prescribe a\\nuniform process for reporting such activities, but each Faculty is expected to\\nmaintain procedures that provide assurance that its members are acting in\\naccord with the principles set forth in this Statement. In considering\\nspecific cases, University officials should strive to make decisions that are\\nconsistent with the general principles this Statement expresses and with other\\nUniversity policies. Because changing circumstances pose new problems,\\nespecially in the domain of information technology, no general policy can\\nanticipate all the issues that may arise in specific cases. Accordingly, the\\nProvost should appoint a committee (which may include Deans of the Faculties)\\nto meet periodically to review complex cases as they may arise in the various\\nFaculties. This committee would formulate and document the \"case law\" as it\\ndevelops, and when necessary recommend changes in the relevant University\\npolicies described in this Statement. In deciding whether to grant permission\\nfor a specified outside activity, the Deans, this committee, and the\\nCorporation will take into account, among other considerations, the extent to\\nwhich the activity: detracts from the appointee’s own work at Harvard;\\ncompetes with programs offered by the University or inhibits the development\\nof programs the University plans to offer; draws upon special support from the\\nUniversity or makes use of its staff and students; is protected against\\npossible misuse of the Harvard name and misleading representations about\\nHarvard\\'s association with the activity; and is consistent with the academic\\nmission of the University. _______________________________ [1].

By accepting membership in the University, an individual\\njoins a community ideally characterized by free expression, free inquiry,\\nintellectual honesty, respect for the dignity of others, and openness to\\nconstructive change. The rights and responsibilities exercised within the\\ncommunity must be compatible with these qualities. The rights of members of\\nthe University are not fundamentally different from those of other members of\\nsociety. The University, however, has a special autonomy and reasoned dissent\\nplays a particularly vital part in its existence. All members of the\\nUniversity have the right to press for action on matters of concern by any\\nappropriate means. The University must affirm, assure and protect the rights\\nof its members to organize and join political associations, convene and\\nconduct public meetings, publicly demonstrate and picket in orderly fashion,\\nadvocate and publicize opinion by print, sign, and voice. The University\\nplaces special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which are essential to\\nits nature as an academic community. Among these are freedom of speech and\\nacademic freedom, freedom from personal force and violence, and freedom of\\nmovement. Interference with any of these freedoms must be regarded as a\\nserious violation of the personal rights upon which the community is based.\\nFurthermore, although the administrative process and activities of the\\nUniversity cannot be ends in themselves, such functions are vital to the\\norderly pursuit of the work of all members of the University. Therefore,\\ninterference with members of the University in performance of their normal\\nduties and activities must be regarded as unacceptable obstruction of the\\nessential processes of the University. Theft or willful destruction of the\\nproperty of the University or its members must also be considered as\\nunacceptable violation of the rights of individuals or of the community as a\\nwhole. Moreover, it is the responsibility of all members of the academic\\ncommunity to maintain an atmosphere in which violations of rights are unlikely\\nto occur and to develop processes by which these rights are fully assured. In\\nparticular, it is the responsibility of officers of administration and\\ninstruction to be alert to the needs of the University community; to give full\\nand fair hearing to reasoned expressions of grievances; and to respond\\npromptly and in good faith to such expressions and to widely expressed needs\\nfor change. In making decisions which concern the community as a whole or any\\npart of the community, officers are expected to consult with those affected by\\nthe decisions. Failures to meet these responsibilities may be profoundly\\ndamaging to the life of the University. Therefore, the University community\\nhas the right to establish orderly procedures consistent with imperatives of\\nacademic freedom to assess the policies and assure the responsibility of those\\nwhose decisions affect the life of the University. No violation of the rights\\nof members of the University, nor any failure to meet responsibilities, should\\nbe interpreted as justifying any violation of the rights of members of the\\nUniversity. All members of the community — students and officers alike –\\nshould uphold the rights and responsibilities expressed in this Statement if\\nthe University is to be characterized by mutual respect and trust.\\nInterpretation It is implicit in the language of the Statement on Rights and\\nResponsibilities that intense personal harassment of such a character as to\\namount to grave disrespect for the dignity of others be regarded as an\\nunacceptable violation of the personal rights on which the University is\\nbased.

Highlights include: Educational and research activities of\\nHarvard should be motivated, and be perceived to be motivated, by the pursuit\\nof knowledge, and not financial reward. Any agreement with an outside entity\\nor other commercial activity should be structured to protect basic values of\\nthe University, such as freedom and openness of inquiry. Educational\\nactivities of the university, including student services, should be free from\\nintrusive commercial aspects (e.g. advertisements on \"Harvard.edu\" are\\nprohibited). Exclusive agreements and agreements which involve holding equity\\nin an outside entity will raise special concerns. Proposed partnerships with\\nan outside entity and other similar arrangements involving a substantial\\ncommercial element must be approved in advance by the Provost or President,\\nand in some cases, the Corporation. The Provost\\'s Office is available for\\nearly consultation and assistance.\\n\\n'), ('Office of the Provost', 'HOME / POLICIES / Principles Governing Commercial Activities: Statement of\\nPrinciples Principles Governing Commercial Activities of Harvard University,\\nwith application to Partnerships between the University and Outside\\nOrganizations As Approved by the Corporation on September 17, 2001 As the\\nsocial and economic value of knowledge that universities create increases, so\\ndo the opportunities for collaboration between universities and commercial\\nenterprises. Through partnerships with such enterprises, universities can\\ntranslate their knowledge into socially useful applications, enrich their\\nteaching and research with practical experience, and secure financial returns\\nto support their educational mission. At the same time, commercial activities\\ncan pose risks to the core values of universities, notably to their commitment\\nto pursue and disseminate knowledge independent of economic and other\\nextraneous pressures. Public trust in the university as an educational\\ninstitution committed to the pursuit of truth and advancement of knowledge is\\ncritical. The university therefore should seek to ensure any partnerships\\ninvolving a substantial commercial element, as well as any commercial\\nactivities it undertakes on its own, are consistent with these core values. To\\nthis end, Harvard University has established various policies that govern\\naspects of commercial activities.1 A number of these policies apply to\\nindividual members of the University. For example, a University policy on\\noutside activities governs the teaching and research that faculty may perform\\nfor other organizations; several schools have conflict-of-interest rules that,\\nfor example, limit the equity that faculty members can hold in companies that\\nsupport their research. Some other policies, such as those involving\\ncorporate-sponsored research or technology licensing, are directed at\\ninstitutional and individual activities of certain kinds. With the increase in\\nthe number and variety of opportunities for the University and its units to\\ncollaborate with outside partners, the need for a statement of principles\\nfocused on institutional arrangements having a commercial dimension has become\\nmore evident. This document provides a summary of such principles. It is\\ndirected principally at proposed partnerships with for-profit entities and\\nnot-for-profit entities that involve a substantial commercial element. The\\nguiding principles should also be borne in mind when a unit of the University\\nproposes to undertake activities on its own that incorporate a commercial\\nelement, for instance, soliciting commercial sponsorship of an academic\\nconference or including commercial advertising in a University publication.\\nHowever, the document is not intended to address routine purchases of goods\\nand services from other organizations, or investments in the normal course of\\nmanaging the University\\'s finances. In addition, it is intended to complement,\\nnot to supersede, existing policies regarding such matters as the use of the\\nHarvard name, licensing of technology, and sponsored research. In view of the\\nstrong institutional interest in affirming the fundamentally educational,\\nnonprofit nature of the University, proposals for partnerships having a\\nsubstantial commercial element should be submitted for advance review and\\napproval by the President or the Provost, and in addition by the Corporation\\nwhen significant new issues of policy are raised. Because such agreements may\\ntake a variety of forms and raise a wide range of issues, the general\\nprinciples stated below do not substitute for thoughtful case-by-case\\nanalysis. In order to facilitate the progress of promising proposals, and to\\nallow for issues to be raised in a timely way, units of the University\\ninterested in pursuing commercial partnerships should involve the relevant\\nDeans as well as representatives of the President and Provost early in the\\nprocess. 1\\\\. Primacy of the Academic Mission The University is by nature and\\nby law an educational, not-for-profit institution. The educational and\\nresearch activities of the University should be, and should appear to be,\\nmotivated primarily by a concern for the advancement of knowledge and the\\npursuit of truth, not by the pursuit of financial reward. (a) Proposals for\\nHarvard to hold equity in a for-profit venture in education or research should\\nproceed only if the arrangement is best suited to achieving the academic\\npurposes of the proposed activity, and only if the prospective academic\\nbenefits of the arrangement clearly outweigh the risks. (Arrangements that\\ninvolve the holding of equity in a publicly traded company raise special\\nconcerns and may require additional review.2) (b) Proposals to undertake an\\neducational, research, or other activity by creating a for-profit entity under\\nthe auspices of the University should proceed only if the same conditions are\\nmet. 2\\\\. Freedom of Inquiry The advancement of knowledge depends fundamentally\\non the ability of individual scholars to formulate ideas and pursue truth free\\nfrom the influence of commercial considerations. All commercial arrangements,\\nwhether with outside organizations or at the university itself, must safeguard\\nthe core value of freedom of inquiry. They should, as far as possible, keep\\nthe substance of the inquiry separate from its financial consequences. (a)\\nAgreements should not create financial or other incentives likely to bias the\\ncontent of teaching and research, or to interfere with the ability of faculty\\nand students to pursue inquiries according to their best professional judgment\\non the merits. (b) The cumulative effects of agreements, considered within\\neach Faculty and across the University, should be periodically examined to\\nensure that the University\\'s priorities for teaching and research remain\\ndetermined primarily by academic considerations. (c) The University or its\\nfaculty should retain final authority over the academic content of any\\nmaterial produced or distributed by a commercial enterprise with which the\\nUniversity collaborates. (d) The responsibility for intellectual products\\nshould generally be attributed only to the individuals or groups in fact\\nresponsible for them. An important purpose of this care in attribution is to\\navoid any implication that the University or its Schools or departments\\nsubscribe to an orthodoxy that might subtly inhibit the freedom of inquiry of\\nother individuals within the institution. For example, individuals rather than\\ndepartments, centers, Schools, Faculties or Harvard University should\\ngenerally be designated as the author of publications, reports, statements,\\nInternet postings and other such material. 3\\\\. Openness of Inquiry Agreements\\nwith outside enterprises and other commercial activities of the University\\nshould preserve an open environment for the conduct of teaching and research\\nand the public dissemination of the results of these activities. In general,\\nstudents and faculty should be able to share ideas that stimulate scholarly\\nendeavors and to have access to data and documents on which scholarly\\nconclusions are based. (a) Agreements with outside organizations should permit\\nthe results of research and the data or other material on which such research\\nis based to be publicly accessible, including publication in academic\\njournals, subject to the University\\'s established policies and standards of\\nconfidentiality and privacy. (b) Faculty and students should have appropriate\\naccess to curricular materials that are produced within the University. For\\nexample, licensing agreements for educational materials produced in a School\\nshould generally permit the School\\'s own students and faculty, and, to the\\nmaximum extent possible, students and faculty across the University, to use\\nthose materials as appropriate. (c) To facilitate the distribution of the\\nproducts of teaching and research in the University in a manner that respects\\ntheir integrity, the intellectual property rights of the relevant parties\\nshould be expressly recognized in any commercial agreement.3 4\\\\. Educational\\nWelfare of Students The student-faculty relationship lies at the heart of the\\nacademic enterprise. Insulating that relationship from inappropriate\\ncommercial pressures is vital to the educational welfare of individual\\nstudents and to the quality of teaching that the institution provides. Care\\nshould be taken, in structuring agreements involving a substantial commercial\\nelement, not to involve students in ways that would compromise the\\nUniversity\\'s obligation for their educational welfare. (a) The University\\nshould not hold a financial interest in commercial enterprises of its students\\nor former students (for a reasonable period of time after graduation). (b)\\nIndividual students should receive proper credit, and remuneration where\\nappropriate, for their contributions to commercial ventures that the\\nUniversity conducts or into which it enters. (c) Students should not be\\nsubjected to unwelcome solicitation, advertising and other kinds of commercial\\npromotions as a condition of gaining access to services and extracurricular\\nactivities for which the University is primarily responsible. For example,\\nstudents should be able to access, without advertising, University-sponsored\\nweb sites for career counseling. 5\\\\. Public Trust Partnerships with outside\\nenterprises and other commercial activities of the University itself should be\\nconstituted so as to maintain public confidence in the University as an\\ninstitution committed to the pursuit of truth and advancement of knowledge.\\nUniversities depend on the goodwill and steady support of their alumni,\\ncommunity and government leaders, and many members of the public, who rely on\\nthe institutions to uphold standards of academic integrity. The University\\nshould therefore scrutinize with special care any agreement that may appear to\\ncompromise public trust, even if University officials believe the arrangement\\ndoes not otherwise jeopardize the integrity of teaching or research. The\\nUniversity should either decline to enter into such an agreement or take\\neffective measures to mitigate these concerns. (a) Before any agreement with a\\nsubstantial commercial element is concluded, it is important to assess the\\npotential effects of the proposed agreement on the University\\'s reputation for\\nacademic integrity and independence. (b) The basic terms of any agreement\\nestablishing a commercial arrangement should be public, except where necessary\\nto protect privacy or other compelling University interests. The agreement\\nshould be transparent in the sense that the explicit terms should reflect the\\nactual purposes and anticipated methods of operation of the enterprise. (c)\\nThe University or its members acting as agents or participants in a\\npartnership should not endorse, or appear to endorse, any commercial products\\nproduced by others. For example, core activities of the University (including\\n\"harvard.edu\" Web sites) should be free from advertising. Additionally,\\npartners\\' Web sites should keep Harvard-provided content separate from any\\nadvertising and should include clear and prominent disclaimers indicating that\\nHarvard does not approve or endorse any products on the site. (d) Agreements\\nwith any commercial enterprise should be consistent with the policy on the use\\nof the Harvard name, and include safeguards that respect the University\\'s\\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights.4 (e) Agreements that create\\nan exclusive arrangement with Harvard are generally discouraged unless they\\ninvolve a specific technology license or particular sponsored project. (f)\\nAgreements should have a limited term, and should be periodically subject to\\nreview by the University. In general, the initial term should be no longer\\nthan five years, and should provide for a review at or before the end of the\\nterm. (g) Agreements should include clear and adequate provisions for\\ntermination, in the case of nonperformance or other serious departures from\\noriginal understandings. 6\\\\. Process for Review Proposed partnerships, and\\nother similar agreements, involving a substantial commercial element should be\\nreviewed and approved in advance by the President or the Provost, and in\\naddition by the Corporation when significant new issues of policy are raised.\\nRepresentatives of the Provost are available to provide advice regarding any\\nsuch commercial agreements, with the goal of facilitating such agreements that\\nare consistent with the academic mission of the University. (a) In reviewing\\nproposed arrangements, the Provost and other University officials shall pay\\nparticular attention to the overall impact on the institution, the effects on\\npublic trust, and the possibility of serious and irreversible financial risks.\\nWhen proposals affirm the broad principles stated in this document, it is\\nexpected that the Deans of the Faculties and their colleagues will be given\\nbroad discretion to pursue arrangements that serve the academic purposes of\\ntheir respective Faculties. (b) Drafts of agreements and memoranda of\\nunderstanding should be discussed with representatives of the Provost as early\\nas possible in the process. The Provost\\'s Office shall also work closely with\\nthe Office of the General Counsel (OGC), the relevant Deans of the Faculties,\\nand other University offices that could be helpful. (c) The Office of the\\nProvost shall maintain summaries and other records of agreements that are\\napproved under these guidelines. _______________________________ Footnotes 1\\\\.\\nThe following listing shows examples of Faculty-based policies, adopted and\\namended from time to time: Arts and Sciences - Policies Relating to Research\\nand Other Professional Activities Within and Outside the University, as voted\\nby the President and Fellows of Harvard College on March 1, 1982, and as\\namended on July 25, 1987, and May 2, 1995; Guidelines for Research Projects\\nUndertaken in Cooperation with Industry, as voted by the President and Fellows\\nof Harvard College on October 3, 1983; Statement of Policies and Procedures\\nGoverning the Use of Human Subjects in Research, as voted by the President and\\nFellows of Harvard College on December 7, 1981; Business - Report of the\\nOutside Activities Committee, adopted October 22, 1986, and Advisory Statement\\non Guidelines for Outside Activities, adopted December 20, 1993; Design -\\nPolicy on Conflict of Interest and Commitment (undated); Divinity - Policies\\nRelating to Research and Other Professional Activities Within and Outside the\\nUniversity (undated); Education - Policies Relating to Research and Other\\nProfessional Activities Within and Outside the University, as voted by the\\nPresident and Fellows of Harvard College on October 1, 1995, and amended\\nOctober 29, 1987; Government (Kennedy School) - Statement of Policy on\\nConflicts of Interest, as adopted on November 2, 1982 and amended by the\\nPresident and Fellows of Harvard College on July 25, 1987 and May 2, 1995; Law\\n- Policy on Outside Activities (undated) and Guidelines for Reporting Outside\\nActivities of Full-Time Faculty Members, as adopted November 1, 1991; Medicine\\n- Statement on Research Sponsored by Industry, as adopted October 1983 and\\namended January 1996, Policy on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment, as\\nadopted March 1990 and amended September 1995; Public Health - Policies on\\nConflict of Interest and Commitment, as adopted on December 13, 1990.

The policy is confined to\\nissues arising from a financial conflict of interest, defined as: “…a set of\\ncircumstances that reasonable observers would believe creates an undue risk\\nthat an individual’s judgment or actions regarding a primary interest of the\\nUniversity will be inappropriately influenced by a secondary financial\\ninterest.” The University has a primary interest in preserving and furthering\\ninstitutional integrity, ethical conduct, and public confidence and trust in\\nall academic and research pursuits, an interest it shares with every faculty\\nmember. Faculty members inevitably hold legitimate secondary interests as\\nwell, ranging from career advancement to obtaining or renewing sponsored\\nresearch funding. Although these secondary interests often align with the core\\nmission and values of the University, they may at times occasion a departure\\nfrom the University's and faculty member’s shared primary interests. The\\nuniversity-wide policy provides a framework for implementation that allows for\\nsome flexibility among the various Schools in recognition of their wide\\nvariance in culture, mission, and the nature of acceptable faculty\\ninteractions with external entities. Each School's approach to implementation\\nof the policy is described in a School Implementation Plan. The University\\nPolicy is supplemented by procedures specific to the implementation of the\\nAugust 25, 2011 Public Health Service Rule (pdf). Faculty at the Medical\\nSchool should refer to the website of the Office for Academic & Research\\nIntegrity for HMS-specific policies and procedures. In addition to complying\\nwith the Medical School's conflict of interest policy, Medical School faculty\\nare also expected to comply with their hospital's conflict of interest rules.\\n\\n\"), None, ('Export Control Policies & Procedures', 'HOME / RESEARCH POLICIES & GUIDANCE / Export Control Policies & Procedures\\nHarvard is committed to complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations\\npertaining to exports of items, services and technology by or on behalf of the\\nUniversity. The University’s Chief Compliance Officer oversees Harvard’s\\ncompliance with U.S. export-control laws and regulations and chairs the\\nHarvard University Export Control Council that reviews and advises the OVPR on\\nexport control issues. Because awareness and oversight of Export Control are\\nbest accomplished at the local level, each School or Institute has an Export\\nControl Officer, designated to answer questions and oversee the implementation\\nof compliance procedures within their respective schools, centers,\\nlaboratories and departments. Below are some common areas where export control\\nissues may arise: Shipping/Carrying Materials Overseas: Any item that is sent\\nfrom the United States to a foreign destination is an export. “Items” include\\ncommodities, software, technology, and information. The export of controlled\\nitems, information or software may require approval from the U.S. government\\nin the form of an export license. An export license permits controlled\\ntangible items or software to be sent outside the U.S. or controlled\\ninformation or software to be shared with foreign persons in the U.S. or\\nabroad. Before carrying, shipping, or otherwise sending materials outside of\\nthe United States, you should consult the International Shipping Guidance and\\nyour School or Institute’s Export Control Officer to determine whether an\\nexport license is required. Traveling to, or Collaborating with, Colleagues\\nOverseas Before traveling to countries that may be the subject of sanctions,\\ncollaborating with a foreign national outside of Harvard University or any\\nperson or entity outside of the United States, or presenting your research at\\nan international conference, conduct an SDN screen.

The minimum standard is set by\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services regulations at 45 CFR 46 (the\\n“Common Rule”). Harvard University has additional provisions beyond that\\nstandard, which help to establish the highest expectations for performance and\\noversight by investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and the\\nUniversity. The following policies and procedures outline these expectations.\\nPolicies Research that exposes human subjects to the unreasonable risk of harm\\nshall not be conducted. Subjects must not be exposed to any risk that can\\npracticably be avoided without impairing the research design. Individuals who\\npropose to conduct research involving human subjects must be qualified by\\nexperience and/or training to safeguard the well-being of the subjects of\\ntheir research. Investigators under whose aegis research is to be conducted\\nhave primary responsibility for determining whether subjects might be exposed\\nto a risk of harm. In making this determination, investigators shall seek\\nadvice from the appropriate IRB. Principal investigators also have primary\\nresponsibility for protecting subjects from being harmed by their\\nparticipation in a study. All others involved in the study share this\\nresponsibility. Each IRB shall be authorized to review and to approve or\\ndisapprove, and to state conditions for, the conduct of any research involving\\na human subject or subjects, in accordance with the policies outlined herein.\\nIn addition to membership requirements stipulated by federal laws and\\nregulations, the membership of each IRB shall be chosen with a view to its\\nability to represent credibly the varying perspectives of subjects,\\ninvestigators, and society at large. In appropriate circumstances, the IRB\\nshall solicit advice from others who are especially qualified to represent the\\nviews of a particular subject population. IRB members shall not participate in\\nthe approval of projects in which they are involved or have a conflicting\\ninterest. Although the typical issues dealt with by IRBs that oversee human\\nsubject research in different Faculties differ greatly, the Chairs of the IRBs\\nshall confer as needed to assure that similar issues are treated similarly\\nacross the University. Investigators shall explain to subjects, prior to their\\nparticipation, the objectives of the research, the procedures to be followed,\\nand the potential risks and benefits. Investigators shall not use individuals\\nas subjects unless satisfied that they, or others legally responsible for\\ntheir well-being, consent to participation freely and with understanding of\\nthe consequences. Ordinarily, investigators shall also obtain the assent of\\nsubjects who are not legally capable of consenting to participation. The IRB\\nmay waive some or all of these requirements only when persuaded that the\\nresearch could not practicably be conducted otherwise, that the potential\\nvalue of the research outweighs the indignity to the subject, and that the\\nsubject risks no other harm in participating. If appropriate, the IRB may also\\nstipulate that additional information about the study will be provided to\\nsubjects after their participation. Investigators shall respect the privacy of\\nsubjects. They shall protect confidential information given them, advising\\nsubjects in advance of any limits upon their ability to ensure that the\\ninformation will remain confidential. Subjects shall not be induced to\\nparticipate by means or in circumstances that might affect their ability to\\ndecide freely. Investigators shall address the equitable selection of\\nsubjects, taking into account the purposes of the research, the setting in\\nwhich the research will be conducted, and any special vulnerabilities of the\\nsubject population. It shall be made clear to subjects that they are free to\\nwithdraw from active participation in the research at any time and without\\nprejudice to their legitimate interests. Subjects who indicate a desire to\\nwithdraw shall be allowed to do so promptly. An investigator shall disclose to\\na subject, upon request, the source of support for the research. Instructors\\nwho assign or supervise research projects and exercises conducted by students\\nare responsible for ensuring that the student is qualified to safeguard\\nadequately the well-being of the subjects. Investigators may indicate their\\nposition at Harvard, but shall not represent that the research is sponsored by\\nthe University or a department within the University except by explicit\\narrangement with appropriate administrative authorities. Procedures An\\ninvestigator proposing to conduct, direct, or supervise research involving\\nhuman subjects shall make certain that the research is consistent with the\\npolicies and procedures stated herein, and that the appropriate IRB has been\\ninformed of existing knowledge of any risks involved. Regardless of funding\\nsource, all investigations that meet the definition of research involving\\nhuman subjects as specified in the Common Rule shall be reviewed according to\\nthe standards therein, as well as any other applicable laws or regulations.\\nWhether or not the Common Rule mandates review, proposed research involving\\nhuman subjects must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval, or\\ndetermination of exemption, if the research presents more than minimal risk to\\nsubjects or if the research involves any of the following: Procedures that\\nmight harm the subjects physically; Procedures that deprive the subjects of\\nnecessary, or accustomed, resources; Hypnosis or unusual degrees of mental\\nstress; The use of subjects who are not able to give free and informed\\nconsent, including minors, prisoners, and individuals of diminished mental\\ncapacity; Explicit or implicit deception of the subjects in any aspect likely\\nto be significant to them; The use of subjects who are available because they\\nneed the investigator’s professional services; Activities that may be illegal,\\nor are likely to offend prevailing standards of morality. Each IRB shall\\ndevelop guidelines for investigations involving human subjects that do not\\nmeet the definition of research as specified in the Common Rule or the\\nconditions elaborated in part C of these Procedures. The guidelines should\\nprovide procedures to be employed for the review and approval of such studies.\\nInvestigations in this category might include, for example, those designed to\\ntrain individuals in research techniques, such as student exercises assigned\\nduring the course of classroom instruction or other pedagogical programs.\\nInvestigators shall submit their plans for using human subjects to the\\nappropriate IRB in the form, and according to the timetable, established by\\nthat IRB to ensure orderly handling of its business. IRB approval is\\nordinarily limited to the specific research plan submitted to the IRB.\\nApproval shall be for a definite period of time up to one year. A new\\napplication must be approved for research continuing for more than a year.\\nExtensions of the specified time that subjects participate, and changes in\\nplan that subjects might consider significant, require further IRB approval.\\nIf investigators detect an adverse change in the health or behavior of a\\nsubject that may be attributable to a study, or if they identify new risks\\nthat may result from subject participation in that study, they shall exercise\\njudgment as to whether to suspend the study immediately. In any event, they\\nshall immediately report the incident to the IRB. Regardless of the\\ninvestigators’ decision about whether to suspend the study, the IRB\\nindependently shall determine whether suspension of the study is in order,\\nand, if so, under what conditions it may be resumed. Study participants must\\nbe informed of any findings developed during the course of the research that\\nmay relate to their willingness to continue participation. This Statement of\\nPolicies and Procedures shall be distributed annually to all faculty and\\nadministrative officers who might bear responsibility for studies involving\\nhuman subjects.

All members of the Harvard\\ncommunity, contractors and volunteers who interact with Minors while\\nparticipating in a Program must abide by these guidelines. Be Aware: Members\\nof the Harvard community must at all times be aware of their responsibilities\\nthat accompany their interactions with Minors, including their\\nresponsibilities under the Harvard Policy for the Safety and Protection of\\nMinors and, if the interaction is in connection with research, their\\nresponsibilities under the Statement of Policies and Procedures Governing the\\nUse of Human Subjects in Research at Harvard University.Be Mindful of\\nBoundaries: When interacting with Minors, members of the Harvard community\\nshould be aware of the vulnerability of Minors and themselves in such\\ninteractions, and be particularly aware of the importance of maintaining\\nappropriate physical, emotional, and sexual boundaries in such interactions.\\nMembers of the Harvard community must not engage in any covert or overt sexual\\nbehaviors with Minors, including seductive speech, gestures, depictions or\\nphysical contact that exploits, abuses or harasses. Physical Contact: Physical\\ncontact with Minors can be misconstrued both by the recipient and by those who\\nobserve it, and should occur only when nonsexual and otherwise appropriate,\\nand never in private. Members of the Harvard community must, before touching\\nanother person, especially a Minor, be aware of how physical touch with Minors\\ncan be perceived or received, and show prudent discretion in determining\\nwhether physical contact would be an appropriate expression of greeting, care,\\nconcern, instruction or celebration. Acceptable forms of physical contact with\\na Minor include high fives, handshakes, fist bumps, pats on the back or\\nshoulder and side hugs. Types of physical contact to be avoided include\\ntickling, rough-housing, wrestling, piggyback rides, any type of massage, and\\nany form of unwanted affection.Discipline: Although at times limit-setting\\nwith Minors may be necessary for safety reasons, members of the Harvard\\ncommunity are prohibited at all times from physically disciplining a Minor.\\nSimilarly, speech, gestures or other behaviors that are bullying, demeaning,\\nbelittling, hurtful, meant to embarrass or make gratuitous reference to the\\nMinor’s physical development or appearance are never appropriate. One-on-one\\nInteractions: One-on-one meetings with a Minor should be avoided, but if\\nnecessary should be held in a public area, in a room where the interaction can\\nbe (or is being) observed, or in a room with the door left open. In addition,\\na supervisor or another member of the Harvard community should be notified\\nabout the meeting at the same time as the interaction or as soon as is\\nreasonably practicable thereafter. Reporting Abuse: Members of the Harvard\\ncommunity must act when there is evidence of, or there is reasonable cause to\\nsuspect, that Minors are being abused in any way, whether in a Harvard Program\\nor elsewhere. Suspected, observed or self-disclosed abuse or neglect must be\\nreported to the appropriate Harvard and civil authorities as described in the\\nHarvard Policy for the Safety & Protection of Minors. Drug and Alcohol Use;\\nOther Prohibited Items: When interacting with Minors, the possession and/or\\nuse of illegal drugs and the use of tobacco products or alcohol is prohibited.\\nMembers of the Harvard community are prohibited from providing a Minor with\\nalcohol, drugs, tobacco products, inappropriate videos, pornography or other\\nsuch items.Gifts: Members of the Harvard community should not accept gifts\\nfrom or give gifts to Minors without the knowledge of their parents or\\nguardians.Communicating with Minors: Communication with Minors is only allowed\\nfor the purpose of conducting Harvard business or otherwise furthering the\\nProgram-related objectives. For the protection of all concerned, the key\\nsafety concept that will be applied to such communications is transparency.\\nThe following steps will reduce the risk of private or otherwise inappropriate\\ncommunication:Communication that is outside the role of the professional or\\nvolunteer relationship (teacher, coach, host, etc.) is prohibited. Faculty,\\nstaff, and volunteers who use any form of electronic communications, including\\nsocial media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and text messaging to communicate with\\nMinors, may only do so for activities involving Harvard business and, to the\\nextent possible, using a Harvard address or site. Before any online\\ncommunications are sent, the Program must first inform the Minor’s parent or\\nguardian which adults may communicate through the use of such electronic\\ntools. The preferred approach is to include the parent/guardian or another\\nHarvard-affiliated adult in electronic communications with a Minor. If private\\ncommunication best serves the Minor’s needs, a copy of the exchange should be\\nretained.Never photograph, film or otherwise record a Minor without the prior\\nwritten consent of the Minor’s parent or guardian.\\n\\n'), ('Drugs and Alcohol in the Workplace', \"HOME / POLICIES, FORMS & CONTRACTS / STAFF PERSONNEL MANUAL / GENERAL\\nEMPLOYMENT POLICIES / Drugs and Alcohol in the Workplace The University's\\npolicy on drugs and alcohol in the workplace is designed to address the\\nUniversity's concern for the health and well-being of its employees, and to\\nensure that the Harvard community complies with the federal Drug-Free\\nWorkplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments\\nof 1989. Penalties for violations of these policies, or for violations of the\\nlaws regarding controlled substances or alcohol, range from warning to\\npermanent separation from the University depending on the seriousness of the\\ninfraction and the degree to which violation of the policy adversely affects\\nthe well-being of the community or the fulfillment of the University's\\neducational mission. This policy applies to every Harvard employee, including\\ntemporary and less than half-time (LHT) employees. Controlled\\nSubstancesEmployees may not consume, manufacture, distribute, dispense, or be\\nunder the influence of controlled substances in the workplace, including in\\nvehicles provided by Harvard, at any worksite or location at which University\\nduties are being performed by Harvard employees, or as part of any other\\nHarvard activities. Common examples of controlled substances include, but are\\nnot limited to: cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. The University will take\\ndisciplinary action against violators, consistent with Harvard policy, and\\nfederal, state and local laws. Such disciplinary action may include\\nsatisfactory participation in a substance abuse treatment, counseling or\\neducation program as a condition of reinstatement or continued employment;\\nsuspension; termination of employment; and referral for prosecution. Reporting\\nRequirementsThe Drug-Free Workplace Act requires that employers who are\\nengaged in activities funded by federal grants or contracts notify the\\nrelevant federal agency of convictions under the criminal drug laws for\\nviolations occurring in the workplace. To ensure Harvard's compliance with\\nthis federal law, an employee must report any criminal drug statute conviction\\nfor a violation occurring in the workplace to their immediate supervisor,\\ndepartment director, dean, vice president or human resources officer within\\nfive days of the conviction. Within ten days of learning of such a conviction\\nof any individual engaged in work under federal grants or contracts, Harvard\\nis required to notify the relevant federal agency. Upon notification of a\\nconviction, supervisors should immediately contact their local human resources\\noffice. Alcoholic BeveragesHarvard University, consistent with the laws of the\\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, prohibits the consumption, possession and sale,\\nand the provision or serving of alcoholic beverages by and to persons less\\nthan 21 years of age. All University employees are prohibited from consuming\\nalcohol or being under the influence of alcohol during work hours or in the\\nworkplace (except that it will not be a violation of this policy for an\\nemployee to engage in the responsible consumption of alcohol at approved\\nsocial functions held during work hours or in the workplace, provided that the\\nuse of alcohol has been permitted in these circumstances.) Under no\\ncircumstances may a Harvard employee consume or be under the influence of\\nalcohol while operating Harvard vehicles or equipment. The consumption of\\nalcohol will not constitute a mitigating circumstance when it contributes to\\nthe violation of University policies. Vice Presidents, deans, and heads of\\nadministrative units have the authority and responsibility to govern the use\\nof alcohol in areas they control, and to require measures to ensure that at\\nevents where alcohol will be served only individuals of legal age will have\\naccess. Those hosting such events must take reasonable steps to ensure that\\nthe acquisition, distribution and consumption of alcohol otherwise complies\\nwith applicable law and University policy. Available University\\nResourcesSubstance abuse is potentially harmful to health. Because of the\\nconsiderable health risks involved in drug and alcohol use, resources are\\navailable to assist the Harvard community in understanding and dealing with\\ndrug and alcohol abuse problems. Harvard staff members can learn about the\\ndangers of substance abuse and get information about treatment and counseling\\noptions available to the Harvard community through the Office of Wellness and\\nHealth Communication of the University Health Services, and Harvard's Employee\\nAssistance Program (EAP). For more information on Harvard's resources, staff\\nmembers, and others may consult the Harvard University Police Department\\nbrochure Playing It Safe, or contact Harvard Human Resources.

In addition, the Program’s capacity and\\nassociated plans to respond to emergency situations should be assessed. Sample\\nrisk factors to consider during this evaluation can be found at the end of\\nthis Policy in the section entitled Program Evaluation/Risk Assessment,\\nAppendix B.Program Policies, Procedures and Related FormsPrograms should\\ndevelop specific Program policies and procedures. The extent of procedures and\\nassociated participation agreements, waivers, health declaration or medical\\ntreatment forms, emergency plans, grievance procedures etc., will be\\ncommensurate with Program characteristics such as Program type, participant\\nprofile, duration, etc. All Programs must adopt a grievance procedure to\\nhandle complaints from Program participants and their parents and guardians\\npromptly and equitably.Programs with a residential component should develop\\nspecific Program policies and procedures to promote the safety and well-being\\nof participants. Items to consider can be found at the end of this Policy in\\nthe section entitled Residential Programs – Recommended Policies and\\nProcedures, Appendix C. Programs should assess any additional and specific\\ntraining requirements for Program staff e.g., first aid training or CPR\\ncertification.Participant RegistrationProgram Administrators should consider\\nobtaining as a minimum:Emergency contact details; andParticipation\\nagreement/waiver forms.Additional participant information may be warranted,\\nsuch as medical treatment authorization or medical disclosure forms, depending\\non the specific characteristics and duration of the Program.Emergency /\\nMedical PlanningAt a minimum, Program Administrators shall develop a plan for\\nresponding to emergency events, including communication to participants and\\nparents/guardians, and shall understand how emergency situations at the\\nProgram level interface with Tub-level emergency plans.Supervision – Counselor\\nto Participant RatioThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health\\'s\\nrecommended staff-to-camper ratios should be used as a guide for determining\\nan appropriate level of supervision of Minors.The Department’s regulations\\nrequire different ratios for varying ages. Generally, the ratios are:One\\nsupervisory staff person for every five campers ages six or under; and One\\nsupervisory staff person for every 10 campers over the age of six.The\\nregulations include additional guidance on supervision for special needs\\ncamps, primitive, travel and trip camps, and specialized activities. See State\\nSanitary Code, Chapter IV) \"Minimum Sanitation and Safety Standards for\\nRecreational Camps for Children\" at 105 CMR 430.000.

Responsible Adults, as well as individuals holding\\ncertain positions referenced in Massachusetts G.L. c. 119, §51A,[2] should be\\naware that they may be considered Mandated Reporters under state law and\\nrequired by law to report suspected abuse or neglect to the Massachusetts\\nDepartment of Children and Families (DCF). Such reports may be made through\\nthe HUPD as described above, or directly to DCF[3] as described below under\\n“How to make a report.” If you are a Mandated Reporter under state law, the\\nfailure to make a required report may result in criminal penalties. Whether or\\nnot you are a statutory mandated reporter, filing a report in good faith\\nprotects the reporter from liability even if the report is deemed unfounded\\nafter investigation. The name of the reporter is not disclosed by DCF to the\\nparents/guardians of a child who is the subject of the report. If you have\\nquestions about whether your position classifies you as a statutory Mandated\\nReporter, contact HUPD or the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). For\\nconvenience, a copy of the 51A report form is attached here:\\nwww.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dcf/can-reporting-form.pdfIf you make a report\\ndirectly to DCF, also notify HUPD that you have made the report.Responsible\\nAdults are also required pursuant to the Clery Actto report to HUPD any crimes\\nthat take place on or near campus, including crimes involving the abuse or\\nneglect of children. The Clery Act is a federal law that requires colleges and\\nuniversities to disclose annual information about campus crime.

See\\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVII/Chapter119/Section21.[3]\\nhttp://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dcf/. What Must Be Reported\\nSuspected abuse or neglect: You must report any situation where you have\\nreasonable cause to believe that a child is suffering physically or\\nemotionally from abuse or neglect, whether the abuse or neglect has taken\\nplace on campus or off-campus, and whether it involves a Harvard-affiliated\\nindividual or not. Child abuse is the deliberate emotional, physical or sexual\\ninjury of a child by an adult or older child. Neglect is harm caused by\\nwithholding life’s necessities: food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and\\neducation (see Appendix A for complete definitions of abuse and neglect).\\nInappropriate activity: You should also report any instance where you observe\\nor believe there may be inappropriate treatment of a Minor, while the Minor is\\non-campus or involving a Harvard-affiliated individual whether on or off-\\ncampus. Examples of inappropriate activity would include violations of the\\nGuidelines for Interacting with Minors (use of tobacco products, drugs or\\nalcohol where children are present; physical boundary violations like\\ntickling, rough-housing, wrestling, massage, or any form of unwanted\\naffection; and speech, gestures, or other behaviors that are demeaning,\\nbelittling, hurtful, meant to embarrass, or make reference to the child’s\\nphysical development or appearance). What Information Should be Included in a\\nReport When you contact HUPD and/or DCF with a report of suspected abuse or\\nneglect, or other inappropriate activity involving Minors, you should be\\nprepared to provide as much of the following information as possible. Do not\\ndelay making the report in order to gather all of this information. Partial\\nreports are encouraged.The names and addresses of the child and the child's\\nparents or other person responsible for the child's care, if knownThe child's\\nage and sexThe nature and extent of the child's injuries, abuse, maltreatment,\\nor neglect, including any evidence of prior injuries, abuse, maltreatment, or\\nneglectThe circumstances under which the person reporting first became aware\\nof the child's injuries, abuse, maltreatment, or neglectWhatever action, if\\nany, was taken to treat, shelter, or otherwise assist the childThe name of the\\nperson or persons making the report (required for statutory Mandated\\nReporters, but optional for non-Mandated Reporters)Any other information that\\nthe person reporting believes might be helpful in establishing the cause of\\nthe injuriesThe identity of the person or persons responsible for the neglect\\nor injuries if suspected or knownOther information required by DCF (if known):\\nwhether the child seems afraid to go home, names and ages of siblings, if they\\nhave similar injuries or signs of abuse or neglect, etc. When Should a Report\\nbe Made This Policy, as well as the state Mandated Reporter law, requires an\\nimmediate oral report to be made when the reporter has “reasonable cause to\\nbelieve” that a child is being or has been abused in some way. The benefit of\\nthe doubt is given to the child.Waiting for conclusive proof may put a child\\nat further risk. Oral reports must be followed by the filing of a written\\nreport (51A) with DCF within 48 hours. Direct disclosures warrant an immediate\\ncall to HUPD or DCF. If the situation is an emergency (for example, the child\\ndoes not want to go home) call HUPD for immediate assistance.It will often be\\nappropriate to discuss concerns about suspected abuse, neglect or\\ninappropriate activity with a supervisor, Program Administrator or Responsible\\nAdult, who can then assist in making the report to the HUPD and/or DCF as\\nwarranted. How to Make a Report Reports may be made through several channels:\\nHUPD: Call Urgent: 617-495-1212 (Longwood 617-432-1212) Business:\\n617-495-1215. HUPD will act as the University’s designated agent for purposes\\nof filing a report of suspected abuse with DCF if HUPD determines that a\\nreport is warranted. Department of Children and Families: During business\\nhours call the area office associated with your campus. Otherwise call the\\n24-hour Child at Risk hotline: 1-800-792-5200. Hotline: Non-statutory Mandated\\nReporters can submit an anonymous report to Harvard’s Anonymous Reporting\\nHotline by phone 1-877-694-2275, or online. The hotline is a confidential,\\ntoll-free, 24-hour resource that is run by an independent, third party\\nprovider. Note, however, that if you are a statutory Mandated Reporter, your\\nreport must be made to HUPD or DCF, and you must identify yourself. Note also\\nthat the Anonymous Reporting Hotline should not be used as an emergency\\nreporting mechanism. For situations requiring emergency assistance, or where\\nthere is imminent danger to a child, contact HUPD immediately. What Happens\\nAfter a Report is Made HUPD will assess the information and determine whether\\nthe matter should be reported to DCF. If so, HUPD will submit the 51A form to\\nDCF and notify the original reporter after the form is filed. If the situation\\ndoes constitute child abuse or neglect, but could be considered behavior that\\nis inappropriate with or around children (see Guidelines for Interacting with\\nMinors), HUPD will notify the reporter of that decision. HUPD will contact, or\\nassist the reporter in contacting, the appropriate Harvard department(s) or\\npersonnel to address the situation. If the original reporter remains concerned\\nthat abuse or neglect has occurred, he/she may (or in the case of a mandated\\nreporter must) still file an oral report with DCF followed within 48 hours by\\na written 51A report. Harvard University will not retaliate or discriminate\\nagainst any person who, in good faith, submits a report of child abuse or\\nneglect.

Examples range widely –\\nfrom archaeological digs to public health studies, from architecture and\\ndesign studios to the development of business “cases,” from studying the\\ncultures of different nations and people to providing policy advice to\\ncountries pursuing economic, legal, and other systemic reforms. Many of these\\nactivities have done much to strengthen Harvard’s programs of education and\\nresearch, and to leaven them with insights drawn from experience in the larger\\nworld. As the University’s outlook becomes increasingly international, the\\nintensity and variety of activities undertaken in other countries can be\\nexpected to grow and to reinforce Harvard’s commitment to a vigorous\\ninternational agenda. Traditionally, most academic activities conducted abroad\\nhave been carried on by individuals or small groups within the University,\\nusually in furtherance of specific projects of limited duration. (There are\\nnotable exceptions, of course, such as Harvard’s Center for Italian\\nRenaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti in Florence, Italy, and Harvard’s\\nparticipation in the construction and operation of an astronomical observatory\\nin Chile.) More recently, as the international dimensions of Harvard’s\\nprograms have continued to expand, interest has been expressed in Harvard’s\\ncreating a more substantial and durable institutional presence in places away\\nfrom Cambridge and Boston, and particularly, although not exclusively, outside\\nthe United States. In some scenarios, this might involve the creation of\\ninstitutional offices or other facilities in remote locations. In others, it\\nmight involve collaboration with universities or other institutions abroad –\\nor other forms of institutional engagement. The variety and experience of\\nHarvard’s past involvements abroad surely hold important lessons. At the same\\ntime, the fact of historical precedent is not in itself a sufficient warrant\\nfor similar practice today or in the future. As is often the case in Harvard’s\\ndecentralized environment, a number of projects have already moved forward, in\\na relatively ad hoc manner; the increasing number and scope of proposed\\nundertakings abroad – and their possible implications for the University at\\nlarge – suggest the need for a more coordinated and reflective, yet flexible,\\napproach. The question of how best to move forward in this area demands\\ncareful consideration. The University’s commitment to an ambitious\\ninternational agenda cannot be fully realized without adequate opportunities\\nfor members of the community to learn, first-hand, about different nations and\\ncultures. Often, in other words, there is no effective substitute for “being\\nthere.” At the same time, the University’s vitality as an intellectual\\ncommunity depends to a high degree on the bringing together of faculty and\\nstudents in Cambridge and Boston, to learn together from one another. Often,\\nin other words, there is no effective substitute for “being here.” The\\nchallenge, viewed from one perspective, is how to encourage the pursuit of\\nserious learning about matters of international dimension without setting in\\nmotion centrifugal forces likely to induce diffusion, rather than cohesion, in\\nthe intellectual community that constitutes the University. This memorandum\\nexplores some of the questions raised by the prospect of Harvard’s asserting a\\nstronger institutional presence in locations remote from Cambridge and Boston\\nin the years ahead. Without trying to frame rigid rules for the many different\\nsituations that may arise, we have aimed to provide general guidance on some\\nof the principal considerations in approaching such endeavors. The question of\\nHarvard’s institutional presence abroad, of course, represents only one facet\\nof the University’s larger international agenda. What is more, matters of\\nphysical presence in remote locations are increasingly intertwined with\\nmatters concerning the possible “reach” of the University by means of\\nnetworked computers and new information technologies. While the narrower\\nquestion of physical presence in remote locations must be understood in this\\nbroader context, we believe that it warrants focused consideration now, at\\nleast in a preliminary way, so that evolving plans can take shape without\\ndelay. There should be clarity from the outset about the substance and scope\\nof any specific proposal to extend Harvard’s presence to locations remote from\\nCambridge and Boston. Granted that the University’s core activities of\\neducation and research are closely intertwined with one another and often\\ncannot be easily unbundled, it is nonetheless important to evaluate proposals\\nfor remote locations with the clearest possible understanding of what\\nactivities would – and would not – take place there. It is one thing to\\ncontemplate a small office that might enable members of the Harvard community\\nto pursue research opportunities in a certain region more conveniently and\\ncost-effectively. It is another to envision a remote location aimed at\\noffering educational opportunities to local residents – or to students\\nenrolled in our Cambridge or Boston programs who wish to add an international\\ndimension to their course of study. It is still another to envision a remote\\nlocation intended to serve as a base for providing policy or technical advice\\nto local institutions, agencies, or firms – or for actually participating in\\nthe development or operation of such organizations. Different kinds of\\nactivities will present different potential opportunities and concerns, which\\ncan be understood and addressed only if, from the outset, there is clarity\\nabout purposes and plans. Therefore, proposals to create locations abroad –\\nand, for that matter, in domestic locations away from Cambridge and Boston –\\nshould clearly define the academic objectives to be served by the proposed\\nlocation, and the particular activities or programs that would take place\\nthere. Of course, there is a tendency for such undertakings to evolve over\\ntime, and a location created to serve one purpose may, in time, seem fit to\\nserve others. In such cases, it will be important to assess any significant\\nproposed change of scope or function. Activities conducted through remote\\nlocations should be closely tied to Harvard’s core academic purposes of\\neducation and research, and should adhere to our fundamental academic values.\\nActivities pursued through locations abroad – though remote in distance –\\nshould not be remote from Harvard’s basic academic mission. They should be\\nclosely integrated with existing programs of education and research, and\\ndesigned to complement and strengthen those programs. They should, in\\nthemselves, serve substantial academic purposes – not be conceived merely, or\\nprincipally, as ways to generate revenues to support other Harvard activities.\\nThey should enable members of the faculty better to pursue their fundamental\\nwork as teachers and scholars, and not distract them from such efforts. No\\nless than activities undertaken in Cambridge and Boston, activities undertaken\\nthrough remote locations must reflect a high level of vigilance regarding the\\nuse of the Harvard name, the importance of the free and open exchange of\\nknowledge, and the affirmation of the highest standards of academic quality.\\nSuch aspirations are easier to state than to achieve. If there is doubt about\\nwhether such goals can practicably be achieved in the context of a given\\nproposal, that doubt suggests the need for substantial caution, examination,\\nand discussion. Activities conducted through remote locations should be\\nsubject to mechanisms of oversight no less rigorous than those applied to\\nactivities here. Overseeing geographically remote operations can create\\nchallenges for any organization, and Harvard is no exception. If the\\nUniversity is to assert a stronger institutional presence in remote locations,\\nit must ensure that geographic distance does not inhibit effective oversight\\nof such operations. It will be important to consider, in advance, how any\\nformal undertaking in a remote location would be overseen by responsible\\nofficials in Cambridge and Boston – academically, financially, and otherwise –\\non the understanding such activities are no less integral a part of the\\nUniversity than activities based here. Indeed, the potential complexities of\\noperating remote locations may well mean that officials in Cambridge and\\nBoston should expect to devote more, not less, attention to their oversight\\nthan to comparable operations based here. Proposals to create remote\\ninstitutional locations should take in to careful account issues of cross-\\nFaculty interest and concern. Cross-Faculty coordination in this domain is\\nessential. From an internal standpoint, a proposal being advanced by one\\nFaculty or School may present opportunities – or difficulties – for another\\npart of the University. It is important that such matters be recognized, and\\naddressed, in advance. Careful thought should be given to whether any proposed\\nremote location should be structured and portrayed as the undertaking of a\\nparticular Faculty or School, of some combination of Harvard units, or of the\\nUniversity. If proposals are conceived initially as undertakings of particular\\nFaculties or Schools, it should be understood from the outset that other parts\\nof Harvard may have an opportunity to join in the support and use of the\\nphysical location, subject to suitable Inter-Faculty arrangements, should such\\ninterests emerge. From the standpoint of outside observers, care must be taken\\nto avoid the appearance – and reality – of multiple “Harvards” operating in a\\nsingle region, pursuing agendas that may appear not to be closely coordinated\\nor even mutually informed. Especially in other countries, where relatively few\\npeople are likely to be familiar with Harvard’s highly decentralized\\nstructure, an activity undertaken by any one part of the institution has the\\npotential to reflect on the institution as a whole. Inter-Faculty coordination\\nis therefore important not only in reconciling various intramural interests,\\nbut also in ensuring both the perception and the actuality that the University\\ndeals with various external constituencies in a coherent and consistent way.\\nAn additional layer of procedural complexity can emerge when efforts are made\\nto explore possibilities for academic collaboration, or for the sharing of\\nphysical resources, among different parts of the University. To some extent,\\nsuch complexity is an inevitable cost of seeking to realize the important\\npotential benefits of Inter-Faculty cooperation. Nevertheless, if such\\ncooperative pursuits are to achieve optimal results, it will be important that\\nthey proceed in a manner that takes into account the reasonable expectations\\nof the proponent Faculty or Faculties for moving forward in a timely way.\\nOperations based abroad demand special attention to local requirements and\\ncustoms. Creating a physical location in another country, and even in other\\nparts of the United States, can implicate numerous requirements – related to\\ntaxation, employment, real estate, licensing, and so forth – that are\\nrelatively unfamiliar yet must be observed. Any proposal to create such a\\nlocation must ensure due attention to the local laws, regulations, and customs\\nthat may bear upon institutional activities conducted elsewhere. What is more,\\ntensions may emerge between local laws or customs and Harvard’s own policies\\nand academic values – with respect to such matters as non-discrimination\\nagainst individuals; expectations regarding academic freedom; and the\\nappropriate relationship between a university and its members, on the one\\nhand, and various public and private institutions, on the other. Whether and\\nhow such potential tensions can be resolved may beat significantly on the\\nmerits of a specific proposal. Proposals to establish institutional locations\\nabroad – and indeed in other parts of the United States – have potential\\nimplications for Harvard as a whole, and should be presented for review and\\napproval from a University-wide perspective by a committee appointed by the\\nPresident and comprising the Provost and the Deans of several of the\\nFaculties. Local, faculty-based initiative has always been, and will continue\\nto be, the driving force behind Harvard’s academic strength and its ability to\\nadapt its programs to changing opportunities and needs. At the same time, as a\\nnumber of the above considerations make clear, it is important that proposals\\nto create a stronger institutional presence in remote locations be evaluated\\nfrom a University-wide perspective. Such assessment should be carried out by a\\ncommittee appointed by the President. The committee should be chaired by the\\nProvost and also include the Deans of several of the Faculties; it should seek\\ncounsel from members of the faculty and others as appropriate. It should have\\ndelegated authority to review proposals for institutional locations in remote\\nlocations, on the understanding that the President and Fellows may be called\\nupon to consider particular proposals when circumstances warrant. Given the\\nintrinsic difficulty of articulating a detailed set of prescriptions in this\\narea - beyond the sort of general considerations outlined in this document -\\nthe group will need to develop more specific standards through the\\nconsideration of particular cases. In so doing, it will want to consider not\\nonly proposals for new initiatives, but also Harvard’s experience with present\\nand past ventures in remote locations. Although it is not envisioned that the\\ngroup will conduct a formal retrospective review of specific projects already\\nin place, the work of the group may well have concrete implications for how\\nexisting projects should be carried forward, modified, or revisited, in order\\nto ensure that they advance the University’s academic purposes and minimize\\nany attendant concerns. The group may also wish to consider whether present or\\nproposed undertakings that do not have a finite duration – or that extend over\\na considerable number of years – should be the subject of periodic review. [1]\\nProposals to enter into formal affiliations with other institutions – even if\\nthey do not involve the creation of a “Harvard” office or facility – should\\nalso be reviewed from a University-wide perspective, with many of the above\\nconsiderations in mind. When the University or one of its constituent parts\\ncontemplates a formal affiliation with another institution, many of the above\\nconsiderations may come into play – even if the envisioned undertaking does\\nnot involve a physical space that would bear the Harvard name. In addition,\\nsomewhat different concerns and challenges may arise. How, for instance, can\\nHarvard ensure that academic activities carried on with “partners” or\\n“affiliates” in other places are consistent with the standards that Harvard\\nsets for its own core programs? How can Harvard ensure that selective\\naffiliations with particular institutions not inhibit the free exchange of\\nideas, or lessen our interchange with individuals in other (non-affiliate)\\ninstitutions, by seeming to grant preferred status to some institutions but\\nnot others? What opportunity would Harvard have to exit gracefully from a\\npartnership that has not met expectations, or has fulfilled its original\\npurposes? Proponents of a specific affiliation should consider whether, in a\\ngiven instance, the formality of an inter-institutional relationship is\\nnecessary to accomplishing the academic objective -- and if so, how the\\nrelationship can be structured to address potential concerns about quality,\\nexclusivity, duration, and the like. The proposed provostial committee should\\nexamine more fully the factors bearing on the advisability of entering into\\nformal affiliations with other institutions. It should also consider what\\nother circumstances – besides proposals to create remote institutional\\nlocations, or to enter into affiliations – would benefit from more focused\\nreview (e.g., activities that involve neither a fixed location nor a formal\\naffiliation, but that would require a Harvard to “register to do business” in\\na remote jurisdiction). _______________________________ [1] This group of\\nDeans, chaired by the Provost, has been constituted and currently reviews\\nproposals to establish remote locations.

All operations should be a model of high-quality in\\nenvironmental health and safety practices. The following responsibilities have\\nbeen established to guide school and department faculty, staff, postdoctoral\\nscholars, and students in their activities at Harvard University: Minimize\\nhazards to students, faculty, staff, and visitors Comply with all applicable\\nenvironmental health and safety laws and regulations Complete required\\ntraining Maintain personal accountability for responsible environmental and\\nsafety behavior within the University community Report hazards and potential\\nviolations of requirements Participate in the development of sound\\nenvironmental health and safety policies and regulations Promote and encourage\\nsustainability through efficient and appropriate use of resources Recommend\\nimprovements to support environmental and safety activities and participate in\\nthese efforts Require those who do business with Harvard to perform their work\\nin a manner that protects the University from environmental health and safety\\nrisks Management Harvard University is a complex organization consisting of\\nschools with academic and research missions, other affiliated centers and\\nunits, and the extensive support functions necessary to the operation of the\\ninstitution. Consistent with its long-standing philosophy of decentralized\\nmanagement, the University places the primary responsibility for compliance\\nwith all applicable laws, regulations, and policies with its individual\\nschools and departments, each under the direction of a responsible “Corporate\\nOfficer” (e.g., Provost, Dean, or Vice President). From a legal, regulatory,\\nand public perspective, the University is one corporate entity (the legal name\\nof the Corporation is “President and Fellows of Harvard College”). The\\nUniversity is held accountable as such by federal and state authorities. The\\nactions of the University’s individual constituents are those of the entire\\nCorporation. For these reasons, the Corporation has the responsibility to\\nestablish policies and provide resources to ensure compliance with all\\nenvironmental health and safety laws and regulations. Harvard University\\nperforms this function through the following structure: University\\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Policy Committee The University Environmental\\nHealth and Safety Policy Committee (“Policy Committee”) serves as the primary\\nsource of leadership and policy guidance on all matters pertaining to\\nenvironmental health and safety compliance and related regulatory\\ndevelopments. The Policy Committee is responsible for monitoring environmental\\nhealth and safety risks to the University and for confirming the availability\\nof adequate resources to assure compliance with environmental health and\\nsafety regulations and standards. The Committee is apprised of regulatory\\ndevelopments and related risks by the University’s Department of Environmental\\nHealth and Safety (“EH&S;”). The Policy Committee develops University policy\\nrecommendations for approval by the President, evaluates effectiveness of risk\\nmanagement strategies, and monitors the effectiveness of, and compliance with,\\nUniversity policies. The Policy Committee provides an annual report to the\\nPresident and Fellows of Harvard College, summarizing the status of\\nenvironmental health and safety programs and risks affecting the University.\\nThe Policy Committee is chaired by the Executive Vice President and includes\\nbroad representation by members of the faculty and administration. Members are\\nappointed by the senior executive of their school or department for a\\nrenewable 3 year term; term appointments may be staggered to ensure continuity\\nof membership. Environmental Health and Safety Operations Committee The\\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Operations Committee (“Operations Committee”)\\nserves as the primary stakeholder body to review and endorse the scope of\\nservices provided by EH&S; to the University community. The Operations\\nCommittee seeks consensus among its membership to ensure consistency in\\napproach and implementation of compliance programs and services throughout the\\nUniversity. The Operations Committee reviews environmental health and safety\\nrisks and applicable regulatory requirements, standards, and best practices.\\nThe Operations Committee consults with other University stakeholders, as\\nappropriate, and advises EH&S; in the development of plans, procedures, and\\nimplementation strategies to ensure compliance and mitigate adverse impacts to\\nthe University. The Operations Committee is chaired by the Vice President for\\nCampus Services and includes Environmental and Safety Compliance Officers from\\nthe schools and administrative departments, the Director of Environmental\\nHealth and Safety, and EH&S; staff support. The Operations Committee may\\nconvene subcommittees to address stakeholder-specific functions or issues\\n(e.g., laboratory safety, facility safety, new regulations, auditing\\nprocesses). In addition to Operations Committee membership, subcommittees may\\ninclude representation from the schools, departments or others with specific\\nsubject matter expertise. EH&S; will facilitate and assist the subcommittees\\nin their work. Department of Environmental Health and Safety The Department of\\nEnvironmental Health and Safety serves as the primary source of leadership in\\nanticipating environmental health and safety requirements and risks, and\\ndeveloping mitigation strategies to minimize impacts to the University’s\\npeople, academic and research enterprise, infrastructure, and operations. In\\nmatters of regulatory compliance and safety, EH&S; is authorized by the\\nUniversity to protect personnel and the environment. It is legally responsible\\nfor numerous permits, plans, regulatory filings and related matters, and works\\nin collaboration with schools and departments to maintain effective standards\\nand practices. EH&S; implements this responsibility through close\\ncollaboration and consultation with University clients, and by providing\\ntechnical, regulatory, and related management expertise.

Purpose - As an educational institution,\\nHarvard University seeks to further its mission of education, research and\\npublic service and to minimize activities that disrupt or are inconsistent\\nwith that mission. In furtherance of this, this policy requires advance\\npermission for, and in some cases, limits or does not allow, photography and\\nvideotaping of University buildings, facilities and property, with the\\nexception of still photography and video work produced on behalf of Harvard\\nUniversity and its schools.[1] 2\\\\. Advance Permission Required - Any\\nindividual or organization wanting to engage in photography or video-taping on\\nHarvard property for broadcast or public dissemination of any type needs\\nadvance permission.All requests should go initially to the Communications or\\nPress Office of the School involved, or to the University News Office\\n(617/495-1585) if there are questions about the University policy. In\\ndetermining whether permission should be granted, the university or local news\\nofficer may consult with the News Office, President and Provost\\'s Office, Dean\\nof the affected school and other university officials who may be appropriate.\\n3\\\\. Criteria and Limits - Generally, photography or videotaping which is\\ncarried out by the university or its schools or an educational or non-profit\\nentity and is intended for educational or public affairs use will be permitted\\n(subject to logistical and security concerns detailed below). Similarly,\\nphotography or videotaping which is carried out by a commercial or\\nentertainment entity designed primarily for entertainment or commercial use,\\nwill generally not be permitted.For example, the makers of an educational\\ndocumentary on the life of Franklin Roosevelt might be permitted to video\\nfootage of Harvard Yard, while the makers of the video version of a best\\nselling novel about Roosevelt set at Harvard would not be.Videotaping or\\nphotography for advertising or promotion of commercial products or services is\\nnot allowed.[2]Access to a School\\'s campus or university property for\\nvideotaping or photography by the news media will be at the discretion of the\\nCommunications or Press Office of the individual School involved, or the\\nDirector of the Harvard News Office. A. In reviewing any request for\\nphotography or videotaping, the following will be considered: Whether the\\npurpose of the photography or videotaping furthers the University\\'s\\neducational mission, as explained above. The level of potential disruption to\\nstudents, staff and faculty. The expense, inconvenience and/or potential\\ndamage to property of the University. The potential for misrepresentation or\\nmisunderstanding of university association with the project. 4\\\\. Exterior and\\nInterior Videotaping - Generally, permission to photograph or video will be\\nlimited to pictures of the exterior of buildings or facilities. Videotaping of\\nHarvard exteriors from a location not on Harvard property also cannot disrupt\\nUniversity activities. For example, a video crew trying to photograph a scene\\nof Harvard Yard from a public space on Massachusetts Avenue cannot cause\\ndisruption by say, placing floodlights in such a way that they disturb\\nstudents in the Yard buildings, or by trying to block pedestrian access\\nthrough the gates for a clearer shot. 1\\\\. In the exceptional case where\\nvideotaping or photography of interior property is permitted (for example, a\\nvideo or still photographs being produced by Harvard for its own use or in the\\nunusual case of a public panel discussion to be videotaped for later\\nbroadcast), a number of special circumstances in addition to the general ones\\nof disruption, etc. listed above need to be considered, including: Have all\\nthe participants (including students or audience members) been notified of and\\ngiven permission to the videotaping? Are alternative seats available for any\\naudience member who does not wish to be videotaped? Have copyright permissions\\nbeen granted from all potential copyright holders? Are all representations of\\nHarvard University or its schools consistent with the University Policy on the\\nUse of Harvard\\'s name? (For example, promotional material for a video, even if\\nit is educational, should make sure that any reference to Harvard University\\nis consistent with the policy and has advance permission). 5\\\\. Signs or\\nInsignia of the University or its units - Because of the trademark\\nimplications, any photography or videotaping (with the exception of that by\\npress invited in to cover University or school events) which portrays official\\nsigns, insignia or emblems of Harvard University or its schools (e.g. clearly\\nidentifiable banners, diplomas, shields) needs advance permission of the\\nTrademark Program. (Schools may develop with these offices in advance\\ncategories of banners, insignia, etc. that will generally be and for which\\n\"blanket\" pre-approval may be given.) 6\\\\. Promoting a Video -The names and\\ntrademarks of Harvard University or any of its units may not be used in\\npromoting a video or other project without specific advance permission of the\\nDirector of the Harvard News Office or the Trademark Program, even when\\npermission to photograph or videotape has been given. 7\\\\. Compensation and\\nIndemnification - When permission is granted, the individual or entity\\nengaging in the videotaping or photography must agree to (a) pay any location\\nfee assessed by the Harvard News Office, (b) indemnify the University against\\nany loss resulting from the activities, (c) compensate the University for any\\ncosts or damage, (d) agree to any other terms or limitations, including\\nspecific ones to minimize disruption or security risks. 8\\\\. Individual faculty\\nand students - Individual faculty members with questions should contact their\\nschool\\'s Public Information Officer. This is not intended to limit current\\npractice of permitting a School or the University to video educational\\nactivities for their own non-commercial use, nor of limiting the University\\nNews Office or individual faculty members from permitting limited, non-\\ndisruptive videotaping or photography for educational or institutional\\npurposes (such as an interview with a news program or videos and photography\\nfor use in university communication) in their offices or other university\\nspace.However, as is also current practice, offices or other university\\nproperty should not be used for private purposes such as photography which\\nwould promote a commercial product, nor should faculty permit the more public\\nvideotaping of their classes or other activities in university facilities for\\nbroadcast or public dissemination without discussing it with their local news\\nofficer or the Harvard News Office as above.Students may not engage in\\nvideotaping or photography on university property intended for commercial\\ndistribution or public dissemination without advance permission as described\\nabove. Any student video or photography project using university facilities\\nmust comply with the University Use of Name policy. 9\\\\. Third-Parties using\\nUniversity Facilities must follow these rules - When rooms or facilities are\\nrented to, or otherwise used by, third-parties not affiliated with the\\nUniversity, they must agree to be bound by these rules, as well as the\\nUniversity policy on the use of Harvard\\'s name. Local units that rent or\\ndonate space for outside use should include these rules in any agreements with\\nthe third-parties, or otherwise ensure notification and compliance. 10\\\\.\\nQuestions - Questions on the application and interpretation of this policy\\nshould go to the Director of the Harvard News Office or his/her designee\\n(617-495-1585). _______________________________ [1].This policy is intended to\\nguide university officials in their dealings with outside entities who wish to\\nphotograph or videotape on university property. The restrictions in this\\npolicy are not intended to limit photography or videotaping by official\\nuniversity representatives, such as the Harvard News Office or the\\nCommunications Office of a school, for university purposes. Students involved\\nin non-commercial projects should be guided by their schools (see section 8).\\n[2]. In the case of a request for photography which is connected with a\\nproduct officially licensed by the University through its Trademark Program,\\nthe University News Office and the Trademark Program will work together to\\ndetermine appropriate permissions and conditions.\\n\\n')]\n"
